### Detailed Training Description

Your employer or company must officially offer you a training opportunity. Ask your employer to write a Detailed Training Description. It must:

-   Be written on the company's letterhead
-   Be addressed to you
-   Include job title
-   Provide a detailed job description (at least a few sentences describing specific duties, tasks, goals, etc.)
-   Specify the street address where employment will take place (street, city, state, and zip code). If you will work remotely, the letter should specify this and list the company’s physical address.
-   Specify number of hours per week you will work
-   Specify start and end dates of CPT employment (keep in mind that CPT can only be authorized one term at a time).

A standard job offer letter may not contain the required information. We recommend your employer uses this [sample Detailed Training Description](https://internationalcenter.umich.edu/sites/default/files/Sample_Job_Offer_Letter_for_CPT.pdf). Please ensure your Detailed Training Description contains all details. If your current offer letter is missing only 1 or 2 details, we may accept one printed e-mail, addressed to you, directly from your employer containing the missing details.

### How to Apply for CPT

Your advisor may also help you enroll in a Registrar Designated CPT course (if applicable).
-   Gather all required documentation. Log in to the [M-Passport portal](https://mpassport.umich.edu/secure), click on **Requests** > **CPT Authorization**, and follow the instructions from there. You must submit all required documents. **The IC will not accept invalid or incomplete CPT applications.**
-   An International Student and Scholar Advisor will review your CPT application. If all requirements are met, the advisor will approve your CPT and create a CPT I-20 showing this approval. Normal processing time is 1-2 weeks. Expect processing time to be 2 full weeks during peak request times such as April, September and January.
-   You will receive an e-mail once your CPT I-20 is ready. No work, paid or unpaid, may take place until your CPT I-20 is printed.
-   Be sure to sign and date your CPT I-20 and keep all I-20s permanently in your personal files.
