### Mutual Fund 
A mutual fund is an **investment company** that **pools** and invests the funds of individual investors in securities or other assets.

```ad-important
**Definition 3.1**: Net Asset Value

The **net asset value** (NAV) of a fund is defined as
$$NAV=\frac{\text{Market value of assets} - \text{Liabilities}}{n(\text{Shares})}$$
```

```ad-summary
**Advantages of mutual funds**
- Record keeping and administration
- Diversification and divisibility
- Professional management

**Disadvantages of mutual funds**  
- High fees  
- Tax inefficiency
- Poor trade execution
- Potential for management abuses
```

#### Types of Mutual Fund
There are a few ways to categorize mutual funds.
- **Open-end mutual funds** (*most typical*)
	- Stand ready to redeem or issue shares at the NAV
	- Priced at NAV
	- Priced and traded at the end of the day
- **Closed-end mutual funds**  
	- Do **NOT** redeem or issue shares
	- **Shares outstanding constant**; investors cash out by selling to new investors
	- Priced at premium or discount to NAV
	- Priced and traded intraday 
	- Traded on exchanges 

Another classification is **passive versus active**.
- **Passive (index) mutual funds**  
	- Long-term buy-and-hold strategy  
	- Usually tracks an index over time
	- Designed to match market performance
	- Manager is judged on how well they track the target index
- **Actively managed mutual funds**: Attempts to outperform a passive benchmark portfolio on a risk-adjusted basis
	- Market timing  
	- Sector/industry chasing  
	- Stock picking
	- Higher fees

```ad-warning
Mutual fund **DOES NOT** trade in financial markets.
```

Another way is by the types of investment they manage.
- Money market,  
- Equity: value, growth, large cap, small cap
- Specialized sector: energy, health care,  etc.
- Bond
- Balanced funds (riskier)
- Asset allocation and flexible
- Index fund
- International securities

#### Fee Structure 
- Front-end load  
- Back-end load
	- Shorter the time span, higher the fee (incentivizes investing for longer periods)
- Management fee  
- Distribution fees  
- Total annual fund operating expenses

The cost of investing in mutual funds is huge - a slight percentage of investment fee makes a huge difference in investment returns in the long term.

```ad-note
Evidence suggests that gross returns of stocks held by actively managed funds outperform the market by 1.3% per year. However, their **net returns underperform** by 1%.
- 0.7 percent due to the underperformance of non-stock holdings
	- E.g. cash holdings to accommodate outflows
- 0.8 percent due to expenses 
	- E.g. fees to fund managers
- 0.8 percent due to transaction costs

This implies that the market is fairly efficient - difficult to beat the market.
```

### Exchange Traded Fund 
A security that **tracks an index** but **trades like a stock on an exchange**.
- Price-weighted or market-value-weighted averages
- Index tracking requirement by the SEC

```ad-important
**Definition 3.2**: Index

An index is a measure of value of assets included in the index.
- The assets in the index can be equities, bonds, currencies, etc
```

There are approximately 5,000 U.S. indices. The three most widely followed equity indices in the U.S. are Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite.

ETFs experience price changes **throughout the day** as they are bought and sold. Because it trades like a stock, an ETF does not have its net asset value (NAV) calculated every day like a mutual fund does.

One of the most widely known ETFs is called the Spider (SPDR), which tracks the S&P 500 index and trades under the symbol SPY.

```ad-summary
**ETF versus Mutual Funds**
- Advantages
	- **Expense ratios** for most ETFs are **lower** than those of the average mutual funds 
- Disadvantages 
	- Lacks active management
```

#### Types of ETF

```ad-summary
**Futures-based ETFs vs. stock/bond ETFs**

![[Pasted image 20240123133844.png|500]]
```

**Traditional ETFs** follow a **basket of stocks** or assets to diversify the funds.

**Single-stock ETFs** bet on **ONLY ONE entity** with issuers usually offering exposure to the daily performance of the underlying company’s stock.
- Reversely, there is **short single stock ETFs**

**Leveraged long single-stock ETFs** target a **multiple** of their stock.
- E.g. Direxion Daily TSLA Bull 1.5 X Shares aims for 1.5 times the daily return of Tesla stock
- Reversely, there is **Leveraged short single-stock ETFs**

### Hedge Fund
Hedge funds are like mutual funds in two respects:  
1. They are **pooled investment vehicles** (i.e., several investors entrust their money to a manager), and  
2. They (generally) invest in publicly traded securities

The main difference is that investors give hedge funds the **freedom** to pursue absolute return strategies.
- Seeking inefficiencies and arbitrage opportunity

Hedge funds use **advanced investment strategies** such as margin, short and derivative positions in both domestic and international markets with the goal of generating high returns.

Evidence suggests that, however, hedge fund managers as a group have strongly  
underperformed the stock market since the financial crisis of 2008.
