### Rate of Return

```ad-important
**Definition 4.1**: Rate of Return 

The rate of return (RoR) is used to measure the profit or loss of an investment (relative to the initial investment) over time and it is defined as:
$$\text{RoR}=\frac{\Delta\text{Balance}}{\text{Balance}_0}$$

See [[7.1 Investment Returns#^167611|total return]] for a more specific definition.
```

In calculating rate of return, we must take into account both **dividend yield** and **capital gain** made on the investment.

#### Nominal versus Real Return 
A **nominal return** represents the growth rate of your money.  A **real return** represents the growth rate of your **purchasing power**.

Let $R =$ nominal rate, $r =$ real rate and $I =$ inflation rate. Then
$$1+r = \frac{1+R}{1+I}$$$$\implies r \approx R-I$$
When the nominal rate and the inflation rate is *sufficiently small*.

#### Expected Return 
Defined as
$$\mathbb{E}(R_{t,t+1})=\frac{\mathbb{E}(P_{t+1})+\mathbb{E}(D_{t+1})}{P_t}-1$$

Where $P_t$ is prices at time $t$ and $D_t$ is dividends paid at time $t$. From that we could define the **risk premium**: ![[7.2 Risk and Return Profile#^419f8c]]
