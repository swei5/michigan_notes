### Efficient Frontier 
Exists in the **mean-standard-deviation** space.

```ad-important
**Definition 6.1**: Efficient Frontier 

The efficient frontier is the set of optimal portfolios that offer the **highest expected return** for a **given level of risk**.

Portfolios on the efficient frontier are **mean-variance efficient** (MVE) in that there is no other combination of stocks that offer that high a return for the risk taken.
```

Portfolios that lie below the efficient frontier are **sub-optimal** because they do not provide enough return for the level of risk.

The optimal risky (**Tangency**) portfolio is where the best CAL meets the efficient frontier of risky assets. It can be obtained by **maximizing** the [[7.2 Risk and Return Profile#^3624b7|Sharpe Ratio]].
