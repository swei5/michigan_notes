### Financial Market

```ad-important
**Definition 1.1**: Investment

**Investment** is a commitment of **resources in expectation of future benefits**.
- **Real assets**: used to produce goods and services
	- E.g. lands, buildings, machines
- **Financial assets**: claims to the **income generated by real assets**
	- E.g. stocks, bonds, derivatives
```

Financial markets can be broken down to:
- **Money markets**: short-term, liquid, low-risk debt securities
- **Capital markets**: longer term and riskier securities and can be divided into
	- Longer term bond markets
	- Equity markets
	- Derivative markets for options and futures

#### Money Market Securities
- Treasury Bills (i.e. T-bills): Simplest form of borrowing  
- Certificates of Deposit (CD): Bank pays interest and principal to the depositor only at maturity
- Commercial paper: Short-term unsecured debt notes, often issued by large companies and backed by a bank line of credit  
- Other money-market securities

#### Bond Market
Composed of longer term debt instruments than those in the money market. ![[5.1 Bonds I#^ec708b]]
The **terms** of the bond are described as part of the bond certificate.
- Amounts and dates of all payments to be made
- Maturity date
- YTM

The bond market includes:
- Treasury notes and bonds: U.S. government borrows funds in large part by selling T-notes and T-bonds.  
	- Notes: maturities range up to 10 years.  
	- Bonds: maturities range from 10 to 30 years.  
- Corporate bonds  
	- Corporations borrow money directly from the public.  
	- Larger default risk than Treasury issued securities.  
	- May come with options attached  
- Other bonds: Municipal bonds, Mortgage-backed securities, Federal agency debt. 

#### Equity Market
Equity market is a broad term for many stock exchanges around the world that match buyers and sellers of stocks.

**Definition 1.2**: Common Stock

A common stock represents ownership in a corporation, is entitled to get **voting rights** and **dividend** payments, has **residual claim** (only receives payout if all other claims (salaries, debt, taxes, etc.) are met) and **limited liability** (minimum share price is zero).
```

Other equities include Preferred stocks and American Depositary Receipts (ADRs).
- Preferred stocks: Trade voting rights for special dividends
- ADR: Allows US investors to trade foreign stocks

```ad-info
**Definitions, Equity**

- **Issued shares**: number of shares sold by the company
	- These shares are either currently available for public trading  (outstanding shares) or
	- Held by the company for future uses such as rewarding employees  
- **Stock price**: cost of buying one of the outstanding shares
- **Market cap**: cost of buying all the outstanding shares at the current stock price
```

#### Derivative Market
A derivative asset is a claim whose value is directly dependent on or is contingent on the value of some **underlying asset**.
- **Options**
	- Call option: Gives holder the right to purchase an asset for a specified price, called the exercise or strike price, on or before a specified expiration date.
	- Put option: Gives holder the right to sell an asset for a specified exercise price on or before a specified expiration date
- **Futures**: A contract for delivery of an asset (or cash value) at a specified delivery or maturity date for an agreed-upon price, called the futures price, to be paid at contract maturity

### Capital Market Structure
Can be broken down into **primary** and **secondary markets**.

#### Primary Markets
The primary market deals with the issuance of new securities. Companies, governments or public sector institutions can obtain funding through the sale of a new stock or bond issue.  
- Shares and securities are brought to the market by the underwriter  
- Besides offering to public, private placements are made

#### Secondary Markets
The secondary market is the market where investors trade previously issued securities. An investor can trade:  
- Directly with other investors (market cap)
- Indirectly through a broker who arranges transactions for others  
- Directly with a dealer (financial institutions) who buys and sells securities from inventory 

Capital market has three primary functions:
- **Economic function**: matches buyers and sellers
- **Continuous pricing function**: enables market participants to get up-to-date price information
	- Provides an estimate of values of financial assets
- **Fair pricing function**: enables market participants to get accurate and fair price information
	- Removes the fear of buying/selling at unreasonable price

### Investment
A basic decision that every investor must make is how to distribute the investable funds in the financial markets:
- **Asset allocation**
	- Choice among broad asset classes (e.g., stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.)
- Security selection
	- Choice of securities within each asset class
- Market timing
- Other

There are two approaches to this process:
- "Top-down": asset allocation followed by determination of particular securities to be held in each asset class
- "Bottom-up": investment based on attractively priced securities without as much concern for asset allocation

#### Asset Allocation
Asset allocation aims to **balance risk and reward** based on our goals, risk tolerance, taxation, liquidity, and investment horizon.

Why is asset allocation so important?
1. Research has shown that most of the returns come from the specific asset class decision, and not from the individual stock selection decision.
2. Asset class choice influences returns: In the process of selecting your asset allocation, you are selecting the risk for your portfolio

Goal of asset allocation is to attempt to **reduce volatility** and provide a **competitive rate of return**.
- May generate a lower rate of return when compared to a single "hot" asset class

#### Security Selection
Once you decide upon an asset allocation that invests in stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, and cash (e.g., 30%, 20%, 30%, 15%, and 5%) you have to choose the particular securities.  
- Stocks: big versus small market cap; growth versus value; industry affiliations such as biotech, financial, oil, real estate; high versus low past return; levered versus unlevered firms.  
- Bonds: government versus corporate; high versus low quality (credit risk); long versus short duration; fixed versus floating rates

#### Market Timing
Market timing is the practice of trading in and out of the stock market or certain asset classes based on **predictions of future price movements**.
