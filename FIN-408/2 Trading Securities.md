### Issuing Securities
- Primary Market: new issues of stocks, bonds, etc
	- **IPO** (Initial Public Offering): offer of securities that have never been traded in public markets before
	- Seasonal offering
- Secondary Market: trading of already issued securities

#### IPO
Process goes as followed:
1. Choosing an investment bank (*syndicate*)
2. Filling a preliminary registration statement with the SEC (*red herring*)  
3. Roadshow / Book building (*book-building*)
4. Approval of the final statement by the SEC (*prospectus*)

**Two IPO Puzzles**
- First day underpricing  
	- 20% appreciation from IPO price to first day closing price (on average)
		- Underwriters want to seize profits by discounting price 
		- Underwriters offer lower price to institutional investors for bulk buying and compensation
- Long run underperformance  
	- IPO stocks underperform comparable publicly traded companies over the next five years
		- Harder to value at IPO
		- Over-optimism and mis-measurement in growth
```

#### Non-Exchange Markets 
- The Over the Counter (OTC) Market
- NASDAQ
	- Computer linked network of dealers (started in 1971, public since 2002)
	- Less stringent listing criteria than in NYSE
	- Multiple dealer system (market makers)

In an OTC trade, the price is not necessarily publicly disclosed.

### Buying & Selling Securities

- **Full-service brokers**  
	- Service fee + any premiums
- **Discount brokers**
	- Commission
- **Deep-discount brokers**
	- Low commission

**Definition 2.3**: Trading Strategies

**Buying on Margin**: Use borrowed funds to invest in securities. Bullish strategy.  

**Short Sales**: Sell securities without owning them. Bearish strategy.
```

##### Buying on Margin
Only a portion of the investment comes from your own money, and the remaining portion is borrowed from a broker. 
- Higher leverage, increasing upside and downside risks

Margin is calculated as the following:
$$\text{margin}=\frac{\text{equity}}{\text{value of stock}}=\frac{\text{value of stock}-\text{liability}}{\text{value of stock}}$$

Stocks purchased on margin must be **maintained with the broker as collateral** for the loan.  

```ad-important
**Definition 2.4**: Margins, Definitions

**Initial Margin** is the percentage of equity a margin account holder must contribute to the purchase of securities.
- Set at 50% by the Federal Reserve

**Maintenance Margin**: is the **minimum equity** an investor must **hold in the margin account** after the purchase has been made.
- Must exceed 25%, else margin call

**Margin call** is a phone call from a broker to add funds to raise margin to required level (maintenance), or else positions will be closed by brokers.
```

Conversely, if there happens to be an upside to the stock, the rate of return also doubles.
```

##### Shortselling

```ad-important
**Definition 2.5**: **Shortselling** 

A market transaction in which investors sell securities they do not own in anticipation of a price decline and they are required to return an equal number of shares at some point in the future.

Short sellers **cover dividend payments** while borrowing stocks. There is a limited gain and **unlimited LOSSES**.
```

Owners of the stock may regain possession of the shares from the short-seller at any time before the contract due date.
