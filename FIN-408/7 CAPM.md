To **operationalize mean-variance analysis** we need estimates of expected returns, variances, and covariances.
- Expected returns are especially hard to estimate 

### CAPM

```ad-important
**Definition 7.1**: CAPM

CAPM is an asset pricing model that relates the **expected return** of a security to its **systematic risk** as measured by beta.

Under the model, the expected rate of return (or the required rate of return demanded by investors) for asset $i$ is
$$\mathbb{E}(R_{i})=R_{f}+\beta_{i}(\mathbb{E} (R_{M})-R_{f})$$

where $R_{f}$ is the risk-free rate, and $\mathbb{E} (R_{M})-R_{f}$ is called the **market risk premium**.
```

The implication is that all investors will hold the **same portfolio** for risky assets: the "market portfolio". Investors should only be awarded for **holding systematic risk**.

The market portfolio will be **on the efficient frontier** (for a given amount of risk offers the highest expected return), and at the **tangent point of the CAL** (offers the highest return per unit of risk).  


```ad-important
**Definition 7.2**: CAPM, Assumptions

1. Investors are **risk averse** and **maximize expected utility **of end-of-period wealth,  
2. Investors are price takers with **homogeneous expectations** about asset returns,  
3. A **risk-free asset exists** and investors can borrow or lend money at the risk-free rate,  
4. Asset quantities are fixed, assets are **marketable** and **divisible**, and
5. Asset markets are **frictionless**: same information, no taxes, regulations and short-selling restrictions.

Note that **CML** (Capital Market Line) and **Market Portfolio** are equivalent to CAL and Tangency Portfolio in Portfolio theory, respectively.
