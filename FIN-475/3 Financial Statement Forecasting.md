### Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Our primary goal in this chapter is to forecast the income statement, balance sheet and statement of cash flows.
- Present value of projected free cash flow (FCF) based on **assumptions** on sales growth rates, profit margins, capital expenditures and net working capital requirements
- Free cash flows are typically projected over **five years**, and terminal value is used to capture the remaining value of the target beyond the projection period

The valuation we obtain from the DCF model is based on **a range of key input assumptions** (aka drivers). We will need to conduct **sensitivity analysis** to assess the influence of key drivers.

```ad-summary
**A high-level DCF Approach**
1. **Study the target and determine key drivers** 
	- **Public firms**: SEC filings, investor presentations, earnings call transcripts, equity research reports
	- **Private firms**: confidential information memorandum (CIM) in organized M&A sale process
2. **Project free cash flow**
	- Sales Revenue $\to$ Rest of IS $\to$ Addition to Retained Earnings $\to$ BS except cash $\to$ CF $\to$ net change in Cash $\to$ Cash on BS $\to$ check for BS parity
3. **Calculate WACC**
4. **Determine terminal value** 
5. **Calculate present value**
```

**Definition 3.1**: Unlevered free cash flow

**Unlevered free cash flow** (FCF) is annual cash generated by operating assets after paying operating expenses, taxes, funding of capex and working capital, but prior to paying any interest expenses. FCF represents cash flows **available for all stakeholders** (size of the pie to creditors and shareholders).

It is common practice to go from EBIT to FCF for the projection period.

#### Earnings Projections 
For public companies, we use **consensus estimates** to project EBITDA and EBIT in the initial years of the projection period. For the remaining years of the projection period, **hold constant the margins** at the level in the last year provided by consensus estimates.

For private companies, use **historical trends** as well as **consensus estimates for peer companies**.

#### Terminal Value, Enterprise Value

```ad-important
**Definition 3.2**: EMM and PGM 

There are two approaches we can use:
- **Exit multiple method** (EMM)
	- $\text{TV}=\text{EBITDA}_{t}\cdot \text{EM}$
		- where $t$ is the **final year of the projection period**, and **exit multiple** ($\text{EM}$) is typically based on the **current LTM trading multiples for comparable companies normalized** through cycles or across sectors
 $$\text{EV}=\sum_{t} \frac{\text{FCF}_{t}}{(1+\text{WACC})^{t}}+\frac{\text{EBITDA}_{t}\cdot \text{EM}}{(1+\text{WACC})^{t}}$$
- **Perpetuity growth method** (PGM)
	- $\text{TV}=\frac{\text{FCF}_{t}\cdot(1+g)}{\text{WACC}-g}$
		- where $g$ is often chosen on the **basis of the company's expected long-term industry growth rate** (typically in range of 2%-4% or nominal GDP growth)

$$\text{EV}=\sum_{t} \frac{\text{FCF}_{t}}{(1+\text{WACC})^{t}}+\frac{\text{FCF}_{t}\cdot(1+g)}{(\text{WACC}-g)(1+\text{WACC})^{t}}$$
These two methods can be linked to carry out a sanity check for each other.
- Compute implied $g$ based on valuation given by EMM, and vice versa
```

From where we are able to derive the [[1 DCF#^fbe006|enterprise value]] and thus equity value:

```ad-important
Definition 3.3: Implied Equity Value 

The implied equity value of a firm is defined as 
$$E=\text{EV}-D-\text{Preferred Stock}-\text{Non-controlling Interest}$$

And thus
$$P=\frac{E}{\text{Diluted Shares Outstanding}}$$
```

#### Sensitivity Analysis 
Outcomes of discounted cash flow analysis are expressed in terms of valuation range based on various input assumptions, rather than a single value
- WACC
- Exit multiple $\text{EM}$
- Perpetuity growth rate $g$

```ad-summary
**DCF, Pros and Cons**

- **Pros**
	- **Fundamental analysis** based on cash flows 
	- Less susceptible to market-level mispricing
	- Without relying on truly comparable companies or transactions
	- Flexibility to run stress tests under different financial performance scenarios
- **Cons**
	- Challenging to **forecast financial performance** accurately
	- Small changes to underlying assumptions can lead to very different valuation ranges
	- Discounted present **value of terminal value can play a dominant role**, which diminishes the significance of annual FCF in projection period
	- Basic DCF doesn't provide flexibility to **changes to the company's capital structure** over the projection period
```

#### Tax, D&A, CapEx projections
We usually assume a marginal tax rate $\tau_{C}$ of 35% or 40%, or use effective tax rate last year

Depreciation is non-cash expense **reducing book value of PP&E** over useful life. Amortization is non-cash expense **reducing value of definite life intangible assets**. It is disclosed in cash flow statement.
- Often included in COGS (Manufacturing equipment)
- Sometimes in SG&A

CapEx is an **expenditure** rather than an expense, capitalized on the balance sheet at the time of purchase and expensed over its useful life as depreciation through income statement. Unlike depreciation, Capex represents **actual cash outflows** and thus **reduces the FCF** available. Historical Capex is disclosed on **cash flow statement under investing activities** section.

#### NWC Projections 
Recall that ![[1 DCF#^9a4442]]
We project **accounts receivable** (A/R) based on days sales outstanding (DSO):
$$
\text{DSO}=\frac{\text{A/R}}{S}\cdot365
$$
We project **inventory** based on days inventory held (DIH): $$\text{DIH}=\frac{\text{Inventory}}{\text{COGS}}\cdot365$$ This is the inverse of **inventory turns**, which measures the number of times a firm turns over its inventory in a year.

**Prepaid expenses** and **accrued liabilities** are projected based on **historical percentages of sales**.

We project **accounts payable** (A/P) based on days payable outstanding (DPO): $$\text{DPO}=\frac{\text{A/P}}{\text{COGS}}\cdot365$$
