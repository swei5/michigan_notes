[[2024-03-12]] #Accounting #Valuation

### Motivation 
We know that firm value is determined by **cash flows** to firm and the **risk of assets**, and we're interested in how debt-equity mix affects $\text{FCF}$, $r$, and $\text{EV}$.
- We assume in its utmost simplified form, $\text{EV}=\frac{\text{FCF}}{r}$, if viewed as a simple perpetuity and with CapEX

In this chapter, we are going to look at how **changes in capital structure** affect the firm value, all else being equal. Capital restructuring involves changing the **leverage** $(D/E)$ **WITHOUT changing firm assets**.
- Increase leverage by **issuing debt and buying back shares**
- Decrease leverage by **issuing new shares and redeeming outstanding debt**

```ad-note
Equity is a **function of debt**, all else being equal.
```

```ad-summary
There are three ways in which we could arrive at $\text{EV}_{L}$, the valuation of a leveraged firm:
- $\text{EV}_{L}=\text{EV}_{U}+\tau_{C}\cdot D$
- $\text{EV}_{L}=D+E=\frac{\text{CFTS}}{r_{E}}+\frac{\text{CFTC}}{r_{D}}$
- $\text{EV}_{L}=\frac{\text{EBIT}(1-\tau_{C})}{\text{WACC}}$

The above are equivalent.

And we have two ways to calculate WACC for a leveraged firm:
- $\text{WACC}=\frac{E}{\text{EV}_{L}}r_E+\frac{D}{\text{EV}_{L}}r_{D}(1-\tau_{C})$
- $\text{WACC}=r_{U}\left(1-\frac{D}{\text{EV}_{L}}\tau_{C}\right)$

And finally,
- $r_{E}=r_{U}+\frac{D}{E}(r_{U}-r_{D})\cdot(1-\tau_{C})$
```

### Derivation 
It is true that (0):
$$\text{EV}_{L}=\text{EV}_{U}+\tau_{C}\cdot D$$
And we know that $$\text{EV}_{L}=D+E$$
Where $D,E$ are market values of debt and equity of the **levered firm**, $\text{EV}_{L}$ is the market value of a **levered firm**, and $\text{EV}_{U}$ is that of a **unlevered firm**, and $\tau_{C}$ being the corporate tax rate.

```ad-info
**Proof of (0): Interest Tax Shield**

Let's always start with an unlevered company. It has $D=0$ and hence no interest expense. Thus, we have cash flow from assets equal to (1): $$\text{CFFA}=\text{EBIT}\cdot (1-\tau_{C})$$
in a world without CapEx, change in NWC, and D&A.

Note that (1) is essentially cash flow available to shareholders, or **dividends**, if such company does not have retained earnings.

**Now let's imagine such company decided to take on some debt** of size $D$. Assume cost of debt is $r_{D}$. Then, there is that (2): $$\begin{align}\text{CFFA}&=\text{CFTS}+\text{CFTC}\\&=(\text{EBIT}-\text{Interests})\cdot (1-\tau_{C})+\text{Interests}\\&= \text{EBIT}\cdot(1-\tau_{C})+\tau_{C}\cdot \text{Interests} \\&=\text{EBIT}\cdot(1-\tau_{C})+\tau_{C}\cdot D \cdot r_{D} \end{align}$$

The incremental cash flow due to $D$ is the difference between (2) and (1): $\tau_{C}\cdot D\cdot r_{D}$. Note that this is effectively the **annual interest tax savings** of the company. 

If $\tau_{C}>0$, then the firm value expands due to **higher cash flows from assets** (via tax savings) or lower WACC (to be discussed shortly).
 
The first part of equation (2) is the cash flow generated by an unlevered firm, with the second part being additional amount of cash flow generated by taking debt $D$. To convert this to the market value of the company, we need to apply different discount rates to each portion: $$\begin{align}\text{EV}_{L}&=\frac{\text{EBIT}\cdot (1-\tau_{C})}{r_{U}}+\frac{\tau_{C}\cdot D \cdot r_{D}}{r_{D}}\\&=\text{EV}_{U}+\tau_{C}\cdot D\end{align}$$

As the unlevered firm introduces $D > 0$, the tax shield becomes larger, and so would the levered firm value.

![[Pasted image 20240313195340.png|400]]
```

Hence we have $$\begin{align}D+E&=\text{EV}_{U}+\tau_{C}\cdot D \\ \to \text{EV}_{U}&=E+(1-\tau_{C})D\end{align}$$
```ad-note
The above seems somewhat confusing because $\text{EV}_{U}$ is simply $E$ given it has no debt. Though it's tempting to assume $D=0$, which in reality is true in the case above, rather, this representation allows us to derive the **relationships between debt and other variables IF an unlevered firm applies debt to their capital structure**.

It's also important to note that the value of equity of an unlevered firm $E_{0}$ is greater than that of a levered firm $E$ by the amount of $(1-\tau_{C})D$. In some sense, we know that we are shrinking equity and increasing debt (by $D$) in our debt/equity mix when we lever up. Why? See [[#^b973ea|this section]].

In all, the above tells us that the **net increase in valuation of levered firm** is exactly $\tau_{C}\cdot D$, the interest tax shield.
```

```ad-attention
In the steps below, we would learn to take $EV_U$ and $r_{U}$ as constant, making $D$ an independent variable - remember, we are interested in finding how change in $D$ impact $\text{WACC}$, $\text{EV}_{L}$, $r_{E}$, and $E$ if a firm decides to take on more leverage.
```

We know that the [[9 WACC#^335717|WACC]] for a levered firm is (1): $$\text{WACC}=\frac{E}{\text{EV}_{L}}r_E+\frac{D}{\text{EV}_{L}}r_{D}(1-\tau_{C})$$
And intuitively, the WACC (which is really just cost of equity) of an unlevered firm is
$$r_U=\frac{E}{\text{EV}_{U}}r_E+\frac{D}{\text{EV}_{U}}r_{D}(1-\tau_{C})$$
We always assume $r_{U}$ constant (given), independent of changes of debt/equity mix.

Multiplying both sides by $\text{EV}_{U}$ gets us (2):
$$\text{EV}_{U}r_{U}=r_{E}\cdot E+r_{D}\cdot D\cdot (1-\tau_{C})$$
```ad-note
This says **cash flow available to an unlevered firm** is the **sum** of **dividends** and **after-tax interest payments** of that firm. Cash flow is distributed among all providers of capital, both equity and debt holders.
```

From (2), if we sub $\text{EV}_{U}$ with $E+(1-\tau_{C})D$, we would get (3):  $$E\cdot(r_{E}-r_{U})=D\cdot(r_{U}-r_{D})\cdot (1-\tau_{C})$$
Which states that **incremental dividends** is equal to **after-tax interest savings**, contributed by taking on an incremental amount of debt $D$.

Rearranging (3) further gives (4):
$$r_{E}=r_{U}+\frac{D}{E}(r_{U}-r_{D})\cdot(1-\tau_{C})$$
Where $r_{E}$ is equivalent to **equity risk**, $r_{U}$ is equivalent to the **business risk**, and $D/E$ is equivalent to the **financial risk** faced by the company.  ^d197d6

If $r_{D}=0$, meaning debt is **risk-free**, this is
$$r_{E}=r_{U}\left(1+\frac{D}{E}(1-\tau_C)\right)$$

```ad-note
In other words, equity holders demand **higher compensation** as the **debt-financing increases the financial risk**. 

**Cost of equity increases with leverages (increase in $D$).**
```

Subbing (4) into (1) gives (5):  $$\begin{align}\text{WACC}&=\frac{E}{\text{EV}_{L}}r_{U}+\frac{D}{\text{EV}_{L}}r_{U}(1-\tau_{C})\\&=r_{U}\left(1-\frac{D}{\text{EV}_{L}}\tau_{C}\right) \end{align}$$ Multiplying $\text{EV}_{L}$ to both ends yields $$\text{WACC}\cdot \text{EV}_{L}=r_{U}\left(E+D(1-\tau_{C})\right)$$
Note that this is effectively (6): $$\text{WACC}\cdot \text{EV}_{L}=r_{U}\cdot \text{EV}_{U}=\text{EBIT}(1-\tau_{C})$$ ^1214fc
```ad-note
At this point, there's a lot to discuss.

(5) implies that with higer debt $D$ or leverage ratio, $\text{WACC}$ decreases. We also learned that $r_{E}$ increases with $D$ in (4). So, in sum, when we change the debt/equity mix of a company, when **leverage goes up**, **cost of equity goes up**, but the **aggregate financing cost (WACC) goes down**.

(6) is effectively saying that cash **flows to a levered firm is equal to that of an unlevered firm**. Why? We are viewing company's value as a perpetuity of all future cash flows - this is one of the key assumptions.

Now this is pointing to the fact that regardless of how capital structure changes, the **PIE (or cash flow available to a firm, or $\text{EBIT}(1-\tau_{C})$ or NOPAT is constant**. The distribution among debt and equity financing doesnot change that. However, we CAN play around with the leverage, namely changing the amount of debt, to affect the enterprise value.

Moreover, if we combine insights from (5) and (6), we come to understand that when we **increase $D$ or leverage**, $\text{WACC}$ decreases and thus leveraged **valuation of firm $\text{EV}_{L}$ increases**.
```

Using (4), we can further rewrite the value of a leveraged firm $\text{EV}_{L}$. Below, we note $E$ has shrunk: $$ \begin{align}\text{EV}_{L}&=E+D\\&=\frac{\text{Dividends}}{r_{E}}+\frac{\text{Interests}}{r_{D}}\\&=\frac{\text{CFTS}}{r_E}+\frac{\text{CFTC}}{r_{D}}\\&=\frac{(\text{EBIT}-D\cdot r_{D})\cdot (1-\tau_{C})}{r_{U}+\frac{D}{E}(r_{U}-r_{D})\cdot (1-\tau_{C})}+\frac{D\cdot r_{D}}{r_{D}}\end{align}$$
Why? Without leverage, we would've had $E=\text{EV}_{U}=\frac{\text{EBIT}(1-\tau_{C})}{r_{U}}$, which is more than $\text{CFTS}$ of a levered firm. In other words, we trade parts of $\text{CFTS}$ and granted government tax shields with $\text{CFTC}$, eventually making the aggregate total larger ($\text{CFFA}$).  ^b973ea

```ad-example
The pie (EBIT) unchanged, CFTS decreases, CFTC increases and CFFA (EV) increases

### Implications 
Given that ![[#^1214fc]]
We have learned that when WACC is shrinking as the leverage ratio $\frac{D}{E}$ increases. Intuitively, **WACC should shrink as the firm is increasingly relying on the debt financing** which is **cheaper** than the equity financing.
- Cheaper as less risks involved and senior claim on assets

![[Pasted image 20240313201138.png|500]]

The increased use of cheaper debt financing also implies lower WACC and firm value also gets higher by $\tau_{C} \cdot D$ by each additional unit of $D$ taken.

Leverage buyout boutiques focus on increasing $D$.
- Identify under-levered firms
- Issue debt financing and make the firm private
- Issue large special dividends to themselves
- Make the firm public again with debt-saddled shares

Corporate inversion focuses on lowering $\tau_{C}$ through reincorporation at a foreign country (even though the interest tax shield is reduced, but the overall tax bill is reduced even more, so the firm value is still higher)

However, it's not that the higher the debt, the merrier. The use of more debt increases the probability (and thus the expected value) of **direct and indirect bankruptcy costs**, and as seen earlier, it is directly associated with equity risk: ![[#^d197d6]]
It will likely lead to these scenarios 
- **Bankruptcy**
	- Legal action taken by creditors to obtain court-enforced repayment of loan from a borrower in default
- **Financial Distress**
	- Substantial possibility of bankruptcy in the near future

The tax benefit is only important if the firm has a **large tax liability**.

#### Optimal Capital Structure 
It is really hard to quantify optimal D/E ratio. Theoretically, we would want a firm to borrow up to the point where the **tax benefit from an extra dollar of debt** is exactly equal to the **cost that comes from the increased probability of financial distress** (MC = MB).
- The cost, however, is difficult to quantify or estimate 

![[Pasted image 20240313204029.png|500]]

![[Pasted image 20240313204047.png|500]]

```ad-summary
We can break it down to three cases.
- Case 1: No taxes or bankruptcy cost
	- No optimal capital structure (DNE)
- Case 2: Corporate taxes but no bankrutpcy cost
	- Optimal capital structure is 100% debt
	- Each additional dollar of debt increases the cash flow of the firm
- Case 3: Corporate taxes and bankruptcy cost
	- Optimal capital structure is part debt and part equity
```

Capital structure also differs by **industries**.
