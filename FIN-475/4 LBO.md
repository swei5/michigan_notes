### Leveraged Buyouts (LBO)

```ad-important
**Definition 4.1**: LBO

A leveraged buyout (LBO) is an **acquisition largely financed by debt** and remainder with an equity contribution by a financial sponsor, who typically requires a **20% plus annualized return** and exits within five years.

Typical capital structure for an LBO is 60%-70% debt and 30%-40% equity.
```

Target candidates for LBO often have **substantial assets and stable and predictable cash flows**, and thus easy to service large amounts of debt. During the investment period (typically five years), the target cash flows are used to **service and repay debt**. As debt is gradually paid down, the **equity portion of the capital structure grows** over time

The goal of a LBO model is to **compute IRR for the acquisition**.
- Push **as high a leverage as cash flows allow** and tolerated by debt markets
- Higher leverage implies less equity contribution and thus higher IRR

Primary IRR drivers include target's projected **financial performance**, **purchase price**, and **financing structure** (particularly the size of the equity contribution) as well as the **exit multiple and year**.

#### Leverage Effect
As discussed in [[2 Capital Structure Theory|capital structure theory]], assuming a fixed enterprise value at exit, using a **higher debt fraction** in the financing structure generates **higher return on equity**.
- As higher debt garners more tax savings
- But with higher tax, the higher risk profile and probability of financial distress

```ad-summary
**Potential uses of a LBO model**
- PE firms and financial sponsors use it to evaluate a potential acquisition
- Lenders use it to access firm credit conditions
- Investment bankers use it to help a financial sponsor client to evaluate deals/advise a client company that is being sold
- Sanity check for other valuation methodologies
```

#### Participants
- **Financial sponsors**
	- Typical financial sponsors are: private equity (PE) firms, merchant banking divisions of investment banks, hedge funds, venture capital funds, and special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs)
- **Investment banks**
	- Provider of financing and strategic M&A advisor
	- Provide financing commitment and internal/external due diligence
- **Bank and institutional lenders**
	- Providers of capital for the bank debt
- **Bond Investors**
	- Buyers include high yield mutual funds, hedge funds, pension funds, insurance companies and distressed debt funds
	- Bond investors receive a preliminary **offering memorandum** (OM) with disclosure of risk factors, preliminary term sheet (excluding pricing) and a **description of notes** (DON) prior to the roadshows
- **Target Management**
	- Works closely with bankers on information discovery, articulates the merits of the transaction and drives favorable financing terms and pricing
	- Rolls its existing equity post LBO or invests in the business alongside the sponsor at closing
	- **Management buyout** (MBO) refers to LBO originated and led by a target's existing management team

#### Deal Motivations
- Target **undervalued by the market** for a publicly traded LBO candidate 
- Target **management failed** to recognize growth opportunities and exploit efficiency gains
- Target can be purchased at a **good price** and supported by a financing structure that provides **good returns with a viable exit strategy**

#### Exit Strategy
Sponsors aim to exit or monetize their investment within a five-year holding period. These exits include
- Sale of business to strategic buyer who pay a **premium**
- IPO
	- Sponsor sells a portion of its shares in the target to the public, typically retaining the largest single equity stake
	- A full exit will come through **future seasoned equity offering** or an eventual sale of the company
- **Dividend recapitalization** prior to exits 
	- Issuing additional debt to pay shareholders (self) a dividend
- **Below par debt repurchase** prior to exit
	- PE firms have the flexibility to purchase the bank debt and high yield securities especially when it can be bought at distressed levels

#### Financing Structure 
The ultimate financing structure is the outcome of bargains among **financial sponsors**, **debt investors**, the **company and management**.
- Financial sponsors want to maximize the leverage 
- Debt investors want to lower the leverage
- Company benefits from moderate debt

Leveraged finance professionals analyze **recent LBO transactions** to determine market tolerance.
- Target sector plays the key role of providing the right context
