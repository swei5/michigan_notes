### Leveraged Buyouts (LBO)

```ad-important
**Definition 4.1**: LBO

A leveraged buyout (LBO) is an **acquisition largely financed by debt** and remainder with an equity contribution by a financial sponsor, who typically requires a **20% plus annualized return** and exits within five years.

Typical capital structure for an LBO is 60%-70% debt and 30%-40% equity.
```

Target candidates for LBO often have **substantial assets and stable and predictable cash flows**, and thus easy to service large amounts of debt. During the investment period (typically five years), the target cash flows are used to **service and repay debt**. As debt is gradually paid down, the **equity portion of the capital structure grows** over time

The goal of a LBO model is to **compute IRR for the acquisition**.
- Push **as high a leverage as cash flows allow** and tolerated by debt markets
- Higher leverage implies less equity contribution and thus higher IRR

```ad-summary
**Potential uses of a LBO model**
- PE firms and financial sponsors use it to evaluate a potential acquisition
- Lenders use it to access firm credit conditions
- Investment bankers use it to help a financial sponsor client to evaluate deals/advise a client company that is being sold
- Sanity check for other valuation methodologies
