Mergers usually come in waves; there may be some common theme or goal but it is almost always tied to **credit boom** of some kind and ends after a **major market crash**.
- Merging for monopoly (1895-1903)
- Merging for oligopoly (1920-1929)
- Conglomerates (1966-1973)
- **Takeover wave** (1974-1989)
	- Mainly financed by **junk bonds**
	- Hostile predatory takeovers and leverage buyouts
	- Ended by proposed LBO of United Airlines fell apart due to lack of financing
- **Technology boom** (1993-2000)
	- Financed mainly by highly valued stocks
	- Friendly regulatory environment
	- Ended when the tech bubble burst
- **Current wave** (ongoing since 2003)
	- Fueled by credit boom from hedge funds before 2007
	- Continued low interest rate environment and surging stock markets kept the wave going strong

**Goal of Acquisition**

The main rationale is that Firm A should only merge with B if
$$\text{EV}_{AB}>\text{EV}_{A}+\text{EV}_{B}+\text{Costs of transaction}$$

This could happen because of 
- Synergies (revenue and cost)
- Business control (financial restructuring and business restructuring)
- Gain in market power
- Tax savings
- Lower cost of financing

### Sell-Side M&A
There are a wide array of options available when structuring a business sale. The M&A banker works with the client to understand selling requirements and strategic goals, including:
- Exit strategy alternatives
- Appropriate buyers and types
- Valuation expectations
- Timing 
- Tax consequences
- Future participation of key management and employees

An outright sale may not always be the best option; also consider:
- Retaining equity stake in the business 
- Selling to employees 
- Identify working or investment partners
- Other hybrids

#### Confidentiality
Confidentiality of a potential sale is a major concern for the company. A leak in a deal can cause **significant strategic, financial and legal ramifications**.
- A change in ownership means a change in business objectives/decision-making
- Public companies are particularly sensitive to leaks as they affect stock prices and, therefore, deal economics

Leaks are generally a function of poorly run processes and can ruin a bank's credibility.

#### M&A Bankers' Role
The M&A banker is hired to run a process, playing purely an execution role that is responsible for:
- Defining exit options and strategies 
- Valuing the Company  
- Recasting financial information  
- Presentation and packaging 
- Buyer qualification  
- Marketing  
- Management coaching  
- Due diligence facilitation  
- Price and contract negotiation

##### Exit Options & Strategies 
There are four (4) basic types of sale strategies a Company can pursue
1. Auction process (aka, “broad auction”)
2. Controlled sale
3. Targeted high-level solicitation (aka, “targeted auction”)
4. Closed negotiation 

The decision of which to implement is primarily based on **the level of disclosure, the number of buyers, and the speed of process**.

###### Auction Process
This is the most **broad and public** type of sale (general public disclosure) - also representing the **slowest** method due to the number of possible contacts.
- 4 months minimum; typically 6-12 months

```ad-summary
**Auction Process, Pros and Cons**

Advantages include that
- It may **identify unexpected buyers**, and
- **Stimulates** sense of competition among buyers

Disadvantages include that
- Competitors, vendors, customers and employees are **aware** of the sale intentions
- Delay in execution and **greater risk of access to confidential material** (“fishing”)
- May create perception of an “over-shopped” deal
- Taint in the event of a failed auction
```

###### Controlled Sale
Represents **limited disclosure** of existence of sale process with a wide range of logical buyers contacted.
- 4 months minimum; typically 6-8 months

```ad-summary
**Controlled Sales, Pros and Cons**

Advantages include that
- It maintains some **confidentiality**,
- Stimulates sense of competition among buyers
- Reasonable market test

Disadvantages include that 
- Competitors and possibly vendors and customers will be aware of the sale intentions
- **Delay in execution**
- **Risk of access to confidential material** by uninterested parties remains
```

###### High-level Solicitation 
Limited disclosure of existence of sale process with **high-level contact approach** to select range of buyers - approach only "logical buyers". 
- Typically 2-4 months

```ad-summary
**Controlled Sales**, Pros and Cons

Advantages include
- **Speed of execution**; minimal business disruption
- Maintains **confidentiality**
- Avoid perception of a “shopped” deal

Disadvantages include that 
- The risk of not reaching full sphere of buyers
```

###### Closed Negotiation 
Limited disclosure with few parties contacted and **focusing on limited parties** who have shown interest in the past. Typical for **highly-sensitive deals** or those who have received an unsolicited offer.
- Time frame can be as quick as 1-3 months

```ad-summary
**Closed Negotiation**, Pros and Cons

Advantages include
- **Speed of execution**
- Maximum confidentiality
- Avoid perception of a “shopped” deal

Disadvantages include that 
- It **may not achieve maximum value**
- Lack of competition and likely will not reach full sphere of buyers
```

##### Valuation 
Traditional methods of valuation are utilized to value a business on a stand-alone basis, such as market multiples, precedent transactions, DCF, etc. The M&A team will spend weeks performing due diligence to analyzes a company’s strengths, tangible and intangible assets, financial performance and growth opportunities.

A good M&A banker finds value beyond the stand-alone business.
- Uncovering growth potential through financial engineering
- Discovering and exploiting buyer-specific **synergies**
- Proper positioning to **maximize value**, for example
- Creating the perception of a **competitive bidding** environment

##### Recasting 
Proper interpretation and presentation of a **company’s financial information** is an important step in the selling process. Financial statements are typically prepared for tax purposes, not for business sale purposes, and **DO NOT accurately reflect the true profitability** and potential earnings capability of a business.

Bankers should **adjust and re-package the financials** in the best light possible - potential buyers should not have to search and dig for value - be placed right in front of them.

##### Presentation and Packaging
When buyers evaluate a business opportunity, they expect the records and facts to be properly organized and documented. A professionally packaged and presented business increases a buyer’s confidence and comfort level, thereby increasing the likelihood of a successful sale.

M&A bankers put together a **host of marketing materials** to help tell the business’ story and properly educate buyers on the Company’s strengths, weaknesses and opportunities.

##### Buyer Qualification 
Depending on which sale process is chosen (auction, controlled, etc.), bankers will work with management to determine the appropriate buyers to approach.
- Strategic fit (strategic buyers or financial sponsors)
- Business culture and goals
- Buyer financial capability 
- Customer alignment

When a list has been finalized, bankers will begin making phone calls.

##### Marketing 
If a potential buyer is interested in learning more about the opportunity, execute a **non-disclosure agreement** (NDA) or **confidentiality agreement** (CA) first.
- The NDA/CA binds the potential buyer to silence regarding the transaction and prohibits any use or dissemination of the information they receive

After an NDA/CA has been executed, release the client’s name and full CIM.
- The CIM is a marketing document and, therefore, is written in a very “sales-like” manner

If a potential buyer is willing to move forward after reviewing the CIM, the next step is to set up an in-person meeting to have **management** tell the story.

Bankers spend significant time **coaching management** on how to present to buyers and what questions to be ready for.

**Communication between buyers and the client is strictly prohibited**. All correspondence is filtered through the advisors. The fact that clients are “walled off”, means that bankers need to provide frequent updates on the status of the solicitation process.

##### Due Diligence 
If a potential buyer wishes to continue discussions and begin full diligence on the company, they will be required to submit a **Letter of Intent** (LOI). Buyers send bankers, lawyers, accountants, employees to perform due diligence. Due diligence means going through thousands of pages of documentation in a designated location called a **Data Room**.
- The sell-side banker is responsible for setting up a Data Room
- All Data Room visits are supervised

Bankers review LOIs to determine **who to admit into diligence**. The due diligence process is handled delicately. Bankers need to be extra careful on who they invite.

##### Bid Submission and Analysis
After diligence, bankers will send out a **Bid Process Letter** outlining the steps to submit a formal bid.
- The bid must represent the buyer’s “best and final offer” (BFO)

Bankers analyze bids based on three basic principles:
1. Value maximization
2. Speed of execution 
3. Certainty of completion

The highest bid **DOES NOT necessarily represent the best bid**.
- “Cash is king,” as stock and other securities have risk
- TVM
- Financing contingencies are not preferred (unless LBO)

After a buyer is selected, the next phase is **confirmatory due diligence** and **contract negotiation**. Once the seller’s board of directors approves the deal, the definitive agreement is executed by by the buyer and seller.
