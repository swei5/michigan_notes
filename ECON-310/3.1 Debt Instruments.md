#Bonds #DiscountRate 

### Overview
Transaction in a given period (at an **instance**) is **DIFFERENT** from transactions **over a given time frame** (the time dimension involved).

```ad-example
Assume two streams of payments:
$$\pi_1=\set{1,0,0}$$
$$\pi_2=\set{0,1,0}$$

Case 1:
- If $\pi_1$ is acquired
	- Consume on Day 1
	- Store it since Day 1
- If $\pi_2$ is acquired
	- **ONLY** able to consume on Day 2
	- **ONLY** able to store it since Day 2

Therefore, $\pi_1$ is superior to $\pi_2$.

We can generalize the problem to, for what values of $y$ does
$$\pi_i=\set{1,0,0,\cdots,0}\equiv \pi_j=\set{0,0,0,\cdots,y,\cdots,0}$$
```

#### Nominal Interest Rate

```ad-important
**Definition 3.1.1**: **Interest Rate (Discount Rate)**

Nominal Interest Rate $i$ is an important economic factor that can be expressed as
$$i=i_{p}+i_{DF}+i_{\pi}$$

```

- $i_{p}$ is patience
	-  Consumption in the future should be adjusted upwards because of the longer wait
- $i_{DF}$ is default risk
	- Should be compensated for any risks that might be incurred
- $i_{\pi}$ is inflation
	- A higher return is expected due to inflation

### Debt Instruments
#### Simple Loans
Lender receives the principal amount plus a fee at maturity

#### Discounted bond
Acquiring bond at a value smaller than the value of the bond in the future

#### Coupon Bond
As the bond-holder, one will receive a series of periodic payments - **coupon payments** until the bond matures, at which the **par value** of the bond will also be paid.
![[Pasted image 20230302210953.png|500]]

The price of a coupon bond is the sum of values of all the **future payments**. As we have seen in Finance lecture, ![[5.1 Bonds I#^4ca547]]
Thus,
$$P=\frac{C}{r}\cdot\left(1-\left(\frac{1}{1+r}\right)^{T}\right)+\frac{FV}{(1+r)^T}$$

```ad-note
We note that $P=FV \iff r=\frac{C}{FV}$.
- This implies when a bond is trading at par, its **yield** is equal to its **coupon rate**. Matches with our observation [[7 Bonds I#^5a2fcb|here]].


More interestingly, we note that the valuation of a bond $P$ isn't a function of $t$.
- The valuation of the bond **DOES NOT** change as long as market condition does not change.
