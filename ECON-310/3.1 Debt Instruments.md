#Bonds

### Overview
Transaction in a given period (at an **instance**) is **DIFFERENT** from transactions **over a given time frame** (the time dimension involved).

```ad-example
Assume two streams of payments:
$$\pi_1=\set{1,0,0}$$
$$\pi_2=\set{0,1,0}$$

Case 1:
- If $\pi_1$ is acquired
	- Consume on Day 1
	- Store it since Day 1
- If $\pi_2$ is acquired
	- **ONLY** able to consume on Day 2
	- **ONLY** able to store it since Day 2

Therefore, $\pi_1$ is superior to $\pi_2$.

We can generalize the problem to, for what values of $y$ does
$$\pi_i=\set{1,0,0,\cdots,0}\equiv \pi_j=\set{0,0,0,\cdots,y,\cdots,0}$$
```

#### Nominal Interest Rate

```ad-important
**Definition 3.1.1**: **Interest Rate (Discount Rate)**

Nominal Interest Rate $i$ is an important economic factor that can be expressed as
$$i=i_{p}+i_{DF}+i_{\pi}$$

```

- $i_{p}$ is patience
	-  Consumption in the future should be adjusted upwards because of the longer wait
- $i_{DF}$ is default risk
	- Should be compensated for any risks that might be incurred
- $i_{\pi}$ is inflation
	- A higher return is expected due to inflation

### Debt Instruments
#### Simple Loans
Lender receives the principal amount plus a fee at maturity. Trivial.

#### Discounted bond
Acquiring bond at a value smaller than the value of the bond in the future.

#### Coupon Bond
As the bond-holder, one will receive a series of periodic payments - **coupon payments** until the bond matures, at which the **par value** of the bond will also be paid.

![[Pasted image 20230302210953.png|500]]

The price of a coupon bond is the sum of values of all the **future payments**. As we have seen in Finance lecture, ![[5.1 Bonds I#^4ca547]]
Thus,
$$P=\frac{C}{r}\cdot\left(1-\left(\frac{1}{1+r}\right)^{T}\right)+\frac{FV}{(1+r)^T}$$

```ad-note
We note that $P=FV \iff r=\frac{C}{FV}$.
- This implies when a bond is trading at par, its **yield** is equal to its **coupon rate**. Matches with our observation [[7 Bonds I#^5a2fcb|here]].


More interestingly, we note that the valuation of a bond $P$ isn't a function of $t$.
- The valuation of the bond **DOES NOT** change as long as market condition does not change.

In simple terms, the price of the bond does not change overtime because increased coupon payments due to longer maturity date are **offset by the discounted face value**, ceteris paribus.
```

```ad-info
**Derivation**:

```

#### Fixed Payment Loan
This is effectively a coupon bond except that we exchange the repayment of the face value by $T-1$ equal payments.

![[Pasted image 20230302220324.png|500]]

Given per period installment $x$ and nominal interest rate $i$, the value of the loan over a period of $T$ is thus
$$P=\frac{x}{1+i}\left(\frac{1-\frac{1}{(1+i)^T}}{1-\frac{1}{1+i}}\right)=\frac{x}{i}\left(1-\frac{1}{(1+i)^T}\right)$$

Equivalently, given $P$, the per period installment is $x=\frac{iP}{1-\frac{1}{(1+i)^T}}$. The derivation looks similar to that of a coupon bond.
