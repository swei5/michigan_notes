### Definition 
Money is anything accepted in transaction in return for goods and services.
- Lots of things could function like money, depending on the agreement

We define two forms of money:
- **Commodity Money**
	- Has **intrinsic/fundamental value** 
		- E.g. cigars, gold
	- Value can be **retained** when the system collapses
	- Acts as an insurance and is of **less risk**
		- To lower the risk of holding commodity money, we store commodity money in a safe location and use **certificates** - this is how **paper money** arises
	- **Controlled by nature**
- **Fiat Money** (Let it be)
	- No (0) fundamental or intrinsic value 
		- E.g. digital money 
	- Agreed to be used as the mean of transaction
	- Only used in infinite horizon (validity never expires)
	- **Controlled by humans and institutions**, through changing money supply

```ad-note
We shall only takes fiat money from another individual if and only if they **anticipates that s/he can use it in the future**. The chain extends **indefinitely**.
```

Economies with commodity money would be more stable.

#### Characteristics 
Money provides liquidity and ability to convert to and exchange goods/services.

In an economy **WITHOUT** money, there is **higher**
- **Transactions cost**
- **Search cost**
- **Double coincidence** of wants (costly, unlikely, inefficient)
	- A wants something from B and B in return wants something from A
- **Problems with specialization**
	- A person will take precautionary steps because of fear of not finding a trading partner, therefore they loses comparative advantage in their given field.

The **distinction** between money, income, wealth is such that
- Wealth: a stock variable (value of assets + liabilities)
- Income: a flow variable (earnings during a given time frame)
- Money: a special asset - used in transactions

#### Functions 
- **Medium** of exchange
- **Unit** of account
	- Measurement of values of all goods simultaneously
	- If money does not exist, there will $n-1$ prices for a single good in a market of Â $n$ goods - each price being a relative price to another.
- **Deferred payment**
	- Used as a metric to plan transactions over time
- **Store of value**
	- Money is an asset that can be spent, invested, and stored
	- Transferable: from income to wealth

### Money and OLG Model 
In an economy **WITHOUT money**:
- Output that CANNOT be stored and is perishable
	- Therefore the optimal strategy is to consume 1, and consume 0 in the next period
	- This is the overlapping generation economy

Using a concave utility function, we have the following conclusions:
1. Utility with money (allowing for savings) at present is **BETTER** than in absence of money - this effect is known as consumption smoothing
	- E.g. Utility gained from $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2})$ is better than $(1,0)$
1. The OLG Model is expected to continue forever. Therefore, in an infinite horizon, fundamentally useless money can improve the economy

### Money Supply
Anything could be money as people coordinate and agree on one specific form as money.
- In the U.S., businesses **CAN** refuse to take in dollars
	- Carrying and storing money is risky and costly
	- Counterfeit bills
	- *Debit cards > cashier cheques or notes*!

We use the terms M1 and M2 to measure money supply.
- **M1**: Currency, Checking Accounts, Traveler's Checks
	- Very liquid and easy/efficient to exchange
- **M 2**: M1, plus saving deposits, CDs less than $100,000, and personal mutual funds share
	- Larger category and less liquid

Both are **NOT** perfect measures of the money supply. There could be a better measure that links to real economic activities.

### Quantity Theory of Money 
First, we introduce the **Accounting Identity of Money**:
$$PY=Mv$$
Where $P$ is the **price level**, $Y$ is the **level of real output**, and the product of the two is the **nominal GDP**. $M$ is the measure of money supply and $v$ is the **velocity of money**.

Applying log to both sides gets us the relationship in terms of rates of growth:
$$\log(P)+\log(Y)=\log(M)+\log(v)$$
Differentiating the equation with respect to $t$ (time) then yields
$$\frac{1}{P}\frac{dP}{dt}+\frac{1}{Y}\frac{dY}{dt}=\frac{1}{M}\frac{dM}{dt}+\frac{1}{v}\frac{dv}{dt}$$
Note that $\frac{1}{x}\frac{dx}{dt}$ is essentially the **growth rate** of variable $x$ over some time $t$. Hence we can interpret the formula above as
$$\pi +g_{Y}=g_{M}+g_{v}$$
Where $\pi$ is inflation, the growth rate of price level. Assume that the **velocity of money** stays constant over time, then 
$$\pi = g_{M}-g_{Y}$$
Which implies that inflation **increases when the growth rate of money exceeds output**.
- This agrees with our intuition: to lower inflation, print (supply) money at a lower pace

```ad-note
Inflation is a nominal variable. We always prefer **real variables** in economics analysis as they directly relate to utility.
```

### Central Bank Independence 
The independence of a central bank can **improve** outcome.
- Not restricted by the government
- The fed is **NOT really** independent - works closely with gov at times

Theoretically, having a more independent central bank leads to **lower inflation**.

### Hyperinflation
**High rates of inflation** caused by high rate of growth of money. 

**Seignorage** is a **real variable** that indicates the **quantity of real goods** the government can consume and collect from the economy by **printing money**.
$$S=\frac{\frac{dM}{dt}}{P}$$
Higher government revenue leads to higher $\frac{dM}{dt}$ into the economy, and thus higher price level and $P$ (refer to [[#Quantity Theory of Money]]). Soon, $S$ diminishes to 0 due to this effect.

Seignorage is available to government (first-in-line).
- Freely issuing new currency, therefore **increasing inflation**
