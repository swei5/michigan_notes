### Money Supply
Anything could be money as people coordinate and agree on one specific form as money.
- In the U.S., businesses **CAN** refuse to take in dollars
	- Carrying and storing money is risky and costly
	- Counterfeit bills
	- *Debit cards > cashier cheques or notes*!

We use the terms M1 and M2 to measure money supply.
- **M1**: Currency, Checking Accounts, Traveler's Checks
	- Very liquid and easy/efficient to exchange
- **M 2**: M1, plus saving deposits, CDs less than $100,000, and personal mutual funds share
	- Larger category and less liquid

Both are **NOT** perfect measures of the money supply. There could be a better measure that links to real economic activities.

### Quantity Theory of Money 
First, we introduce the **Accounting Identity of Money**:
$$PY=Mv$$
Where $P$ is the **price level**, $Y$ is the **level of real output**, and the product of the two is the **nominal GDP**. $M$ is the measure of money supply and $v$ is the **velocity of money**.
