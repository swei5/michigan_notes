A forward contract is an agreement to transact in the future. It can be written to **meet particular requirements**, but buyers and sellers are responsible for **managing counterparty default risk**.

A futures contract is a **standardized forward contract** traded on an **exchange**. It offers **liquidity and protection** to buyers and sellers because a clearing house takes on default risk.
- Offset by a **requirement** of buyers and sellers to post a margin, e.g. 10% of payoff to close the position
- Can be traded on exchanges

In this section, we will treat all contracts – futures and forwards – as **forward contracts**. This means we will not consider the ongoing requirement to post a margin.
