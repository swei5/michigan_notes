### Real options
A real optionÂ gives a firm's management the right, but not the obligation to undertake certain **business opportunities or investments**.
- Multi-stage investments 
- High dispersion of payoffs depending upon ultimate success or failure
- Drug development, device research, etc.

Pathways create options. Risk lowers value, and options increase value.

In fact, all investments can be valued using real options analysis. But the option value increases along with **multiple stages**, **dispersion of payoffs** and **flexibility** in decision-making.

There's some distinction between irreversible investment and investment with **options**.

### Valuation
Our fundamental valuation principle has always been that the value of any asset is the **present value of expected cash flows**, or, the probability weighted average of all possible cash flows.
- However, for projects with options the use of a scenario based model fails, because there are many paths the project could take & a single scenario based model cannot handle this

Real options analysis can be implemented in two phases, with the first phase being most important.  
- **Phase 1**: use a binomial tree to correctly work out the timing & magnitude of expected cash flows, & convert them to present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. This ensures that we correctly estimate the expected cash flows
- **Phase 2**: extend the analysis to incorporate the **risk reduction that comes from embedded options** - the valuation performed at Phase 2 should **always be HIGHER**  than the valuation performed in Phase 1 & is the more accurate valuation.
