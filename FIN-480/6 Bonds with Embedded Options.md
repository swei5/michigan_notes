### Overview
**Call** option **benefits the bond issuer** (most prevalent). 
- In contrast to bonds issued in the 1990s, most investment-grade corporate bonds have a make-whole call provision, in which the call price compensates the bondholder for surrendering the bond
- The call price is determined at different points in time by **discounting remaining coupon payments and face value repayment** at an interest rate which is a small spread above Treasury yields
- American, European, Bermudan (specified possible redemption dates)

**Put** option **benefits the bond holder**.
- American, European 

**Extension** option **benefits the bond holder**. **Conversion** to equity option **benefits the bond holder**.

### Valuation
The value of a **callable bond** is the value of a **straight bond** - the value of the **issuer call option**.
- Value the **straight bond** by **discounted coupons and face value at an estimate of YTM** OR by using a **binomial tree**
- Value the callable bond using a **binomial tree**
- Work out the value of the call option using the difference between the two

The value of a **puttable bond** is the value of a **straight bond** + the value of the **investor put option**.
- Work out the valuation in similar fashion as for callable bonds
