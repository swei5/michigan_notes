### Forward Contracts Value
Suppose one takes a long position of a forward contract made today on an underlying asset $S$ with delivery date $T$ and forward price $F(0,T)$.

Let's first build on some intuitions:
- Its value today $V(0)=0$ since we can enter a forward contract freely today
- Its value at $T$: $V(T)=S(T)-F(0,T)$
- $V(t)$ should depend on the stock price $S(t)$ and future dividends, probably through $F(t,T)$

```ad-important
**Definition 10.1**: Forward Contracts Values

For any $t\in[0,T]$, the time $t$ value $V(t)$ for a **LONG** forward contract with forward price $F(0,T)$ is given by $$V(t)=[F(t,T)-F(0,T)]e^{-r(T-t)}$$ where, as we mentioned before, $F (t, T )$ is the forward price of another forward contract made at time $t$.

The value for a **SHORT** position is given by $$V(t)=[F(0,T)-F(t,T)]e^{-r(T-t)}$$
```

```ad-warning
Note the distinction between **Forward Contracts Value** and **[[9 Forward and Futures I#^0734c3|Forward Price]]**.
```

Here, we are **NOT assuming** no dividends; if a stock pays **NO dividends**, then we have $$\begin{align}
V(t)=[F(t,T)-F(0,T)]e^{-r(T-t)}&=[S(t)e^{r(T-t)}-S(0)e^{rT}]e^{-r(T-t)}\\
&= S(t)-S(0)e^{rt}
\end{align}$$
```ad-note
The above implies that if the stock price $S(t)$ growsÂ at the **same rate as a risk-free investment** $S (0) \to S(0)e^{rt}$, then the value of the forward contract will be 0.

Growth of $S(t)$ **ABOVE** the risk free rate $r$ results in a gain for the holder of a long forward position. Intuitively, they would be more likely to buy at time $T$ at the forward price $F(0,T)$ for a stock with high price.
```

```ad-note
**Proof of Definition 10.1**

Proof by no-arbitrage principle: Suppose that we start from $0$ dollar at time $0$. Then, at time $t$:
- **LONG** forward contract with forward price $F(0,T)$: $-V(t)$
- Enter a **SHORT** forward position with forward price $F(t,T)$
- **BORROW** $V(t)$ from the bank: $+V(t)$
- Total Payoff: $0$

At time $T$:
- From **LONG** forward: $S(T)-F(0,T)$
- From **SHORT** forward: $F(t,T)-S(T)$
- From the bank loan: $-V(t)e^{r(T-t)}$

Our total wealth is therefore $$[S(T)-F(0,T)]+[F(t,T)-S(T)]-V(t)e^{r(T-t)}=F(t,T)-F(0,T)-V(t)e^{r(T-t)}$$

Thus, $$\begin{cases}
V(t) < [F(t,T)-F(0,T)]e^{-r(T-t)} & \text{ above gives A.O.} \\
V(t) > [F(t,T)-F(0,T)]e^{-r(T-t)} & \text{ above gives A.O.}
\end{cases}$$

Then, we must have $V(t)=[F(t,T)-F(0,T)]e^{r(T-t)}$.

### Future Contracts
One of the two parties to a forward contract will **LOST** (perhaps a lot of) money at the delivery date $T$. There is always a **risk of default** by the party suffering a loss. **Futures contracts** are designed to eliminate such risk, by involving a stream of (random) payments during the lifetime of the contract.

```ad-important
**Definition 10.2**: Futures Contract

Like a forward contract, a **futures contract** is based on an **underlying asset** $S(t)$ and has a specific time $T$ of delivery. 

In addition to $S(t)$, the market will determine a **futures price** $f(t,T)$ for each $t \le T$. These prices are unknown (random variables) at time $0$ except for $f(0,T)$.

It costs **NOTHING** to enter a futures position; however, there are prescribed time instants $t_{1} < t_{2} < \cdots < t_{N}=T$ where the holder of a long futures position will receive (or pay to) the short side the amount $f(t_{n},T)-f(t_{n-1},T)$ if positive (negative).
- This cash flow is known as **marking to market** (MTM)
```

The relatively small cash settlement between two parts of a futures contract at each times $t_{n}$ is an advantage to **avoid the possible default** as happened in the case of forward contract.

```ad-note
$f(t_{n},T)$, although named *futures price*, is **NOT the value** of the futures contract at time $t_n$. Futures contract is always worth $0$ at each time $t$.

Note that $f(T,T)=S(T)$.
```

```ad-important
**Definition 10.3**: Future Contracts Value 

If interest rate is constant, then $f(0,T)=F(0,T)$.

If the underlying stock pays **NO dividends** and the continuous compounding interest rate $r$ is constant, then $$f(t,T)=S(t)e^{r(T-t)}=F(t,T)$$
```

```ad-summary
**Summary**: Futures and Forwards Contracts

```

#### Mark to Market
Each party has to deposit in an account (exclusively used for this futures agreement) a portion of the futures price $f(t_n, T )$, e.g. 10%, which is called the **initial margin**. Then, at the end of every day, cash flows from one account to the other are realized depending on the **sign of the difference** $$f(t_{n},T)-f(t_{n-1},T)$$
Any excess that builds up above the initial margin can be withdrawn.

If the balance drops below a specific level, e.g. 5% of the current futures price, which is called the **maintenance margin**, then a margin call will be issued, requesting the respective party to **make a deposit** so that the balance returns back to the initial margin, which now is 10% of the **current futures price**.
- If the investor fails to respond, then the futures positions will be closed
