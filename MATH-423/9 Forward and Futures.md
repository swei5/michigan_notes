**Definition 9.1**: Forward Contract

A forward contract is an agreement to buy or sell a risky asset (typically a stock) at a fixed future date $T$ , called **delivery date**, for a price $F (0, T )$ determined today, called **forward price**.
```

The principal reason for entering into a forward contract is to become **independent of the unknown future price** of a risky asset. In the agreement, the party obliged to buy (sell) the asset is said to take a long (short) forward position.

Forward contracts are designed to enter freely, i.e. **NO initial payment**. The forward price **IS NOT** the **value** of the forward contract.

```ad-note
The future value of a **LONG** forward position at time T is $S(T )−F (0, T )$.

The future value of a **SHORT** forward position at time T is $F (0, T )−S(T )$.
