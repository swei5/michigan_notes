#### $N$ -step Binomial Tree Model (i.d.)
Prior to this lecture, we've considered a $N$ -step binomial tree model where one-step returns $K (n), n=1,2,...$ are **i.i.d.** such that for each $n$, $$K(n)=\begin{cases}
u \text{ with probability }p \\
d \text{ with probability }(1-p) \\
\end{cases}$$ where $-1<d<u$ and $p\in (0,1)$. 

Let us consider now a (non-standard) binomial model for the stock prices $S$, where the one-step returns are **NOT identically distributed** (i.d.).
