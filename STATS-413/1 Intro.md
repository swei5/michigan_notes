[[2024-08-26]] #Regression

Our main goal is to use **data** to infer relationships between a single response variable and one or more other predictor variables.
- Then, to improve predictions of our response variable by leveraging information contained in the predictors (functions)

In regression analysis, we seek to predict values of the **response variable** (outcome variable, $y$) as a function of one or more **predictor variables** (covariates, $x$). When performing a regression, we say that we **regress** the values of the $y$ variable on the values of the $x$ variables.
