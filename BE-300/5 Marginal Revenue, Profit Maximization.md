### Marginal Revenue
$MR$ has the same intercept as **inverse demand curve** and **twice** the slope.

$$P=a-bQ\to MR=a-2bQ$$

In this case, max revenue occurs at $Q=6$ as that point indicates $MR=0$.
- That means, optimal output (max profit, where $MR=MC$) has to be in the interval $[0,6]$
	- Doesn't make sense to produce in $[6,\infty)$ as $MR$ is negative in the region
	- Price elasticity of demand is less than 1 in the region - implying $R$ goes down as $Q$ goes up

$MR$ is **NOT** equivalent to price.

### Costs
- $MC$ curve depends only on the $VC$, no fixed costs.
	- When $MC$ is constant, $AVC$ is constant at the **same level**
