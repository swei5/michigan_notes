### Simultaneous Games
Players choose their strategies at the **same time**.
- E.g. gas station, movie advertisement

#### Prisoner's Dilemma
Gas station game and advertising game are both examples of a “prisoner’s dilemma” type game.
- Both players have a **dominant strategy** and game has a **dominant strategy** **equilibrium**
- Payoffs for each player **AT** this **equilibrium** are **WORSE** than some other possible outcome of game

There are mainly two ways out of this dilemma:
1. Repeated interactions/tacit collusion
2. Product differentiation (location, branding, advertising, quality, etc.)

### Nash Equilibrium

```ad-important
**Definition 16.1**: Nash Equilibrium

Nash equilibrium (Nash, 1950, PNAS)is an equilibrium in which **NO** player  
wants to **change** their behavior given what other players are doing.
- Given what other players are doing, each player is playing a **best response**
- Games can have multiple Nash equilibria
```

#### Finding Nash Equilibrium
We consider, for each player, best response to **all hypothetical strategies** of opposing **player**.
1. From Player 1’s perspective, for all hypothetical strategies for Player 2, find Player 1’s best response.  
2. From Player 2’s perspective, for all hypothetical strategies for Player 1, find Player 2’s best response  
3. Boxes that are best responses for both players are therefore Nash equilibria 

```ad-note
Notes on Nash Equilibrium:
- Even if there are no dominant strategies, there can still be Nash equilibria
	- Nash equilibrium isn't necessarily a dominant strategy
- If **each** player has dominant strategy, those strategies will be the Nash equilibria  
- In games with multiple Nash equilibria, can’t predict how players will behave  
```

If you do not have a dominant strategy of your own, see if your rival does.  
- Then select strategy that maximizes your payoffs given strategy of your rival.

When there are **multiple** Nash equilibria, and the players **CANNOT** communicate, it is difficult to tell which one will actually occur.

```ad-important
**Definition 16.2**: Focal Point

Sometimes one Nash equilibrium seems more likely; in game theory, a focal point is a solution that people tend to use in the **absence of communication** because it seems natural, obvious, or special.
