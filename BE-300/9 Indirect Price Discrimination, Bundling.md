### Indirect Price Discrimination
##### Inter-temporal price discrimination
Charge a high price early on, then drop it later.
- Electronics, books
- Sales and outlets
- Airline pricing: charge lower fares to price sensitive leisure travelers than to price insensitive business travelers for equivalent seats

##### Versioning

```ad-important
**Definition 9.1**: **Versioning**

A pricing strategy where a firm offers **different** **versions** of a product at different prices to attract various consumer types.
- Determine **consumer surplus** generated for each type at a **given price** for the “budget” version
- Set price for *high end* version so it just generates exactly the same in consumer surplus for the second type of consumer
- Check “incentive compatibility,” i.e., **NEITHER** type consumer prefers the other version
```

Examples:
- Airline tickets: business travelers
- Tax software
- Designers

Versioning is not exactly price discrimination because
- **Marginal cost** of serving different customer types can **change**
- Different versions of product need not be identical

#### Quantity Discounts

```ad-important
**Definition 9.2**: **Quantity Discounts**

A firm offers customers who buy **larger** quantities of a good a **lower** per-unit price
- Useful if one consumer type has **elastic** demand
```

Examples
- Frequent or high-volume users (public transportation)
- Locals vs out-of-town
- Loyalty programs
- Firms vs individuals

```ad-example
The online brokerage house E\*TRADE has two customer types: obsessed and uninterested traders:

$$Q_{obs}=200-10P$$
$$Q_{uin}=5-P/10$$

E*TRADE has $MC = 10$ per trade and cannot tell whether its new customers are “obsessed” or “uninterested.”
- Setting two prices would fail because all would purchase at the lower price

Quantity discounts provide E*TRADE with an opportunity to let its customers **reveal** their type, and capture more of their surplus.

```

Both versioning and quantity discounts require
- Firms with market **power** and **different** consumer types
- Individual consumers are **self-selecting** (as opposed to segmentation)
- Each consumer chooses version which generates **largest consumer surplus** for the **individual** (check for incentive compatibility)

### Bundling

```ad-important
**Definition 9.3**: **Bundling**

Bundling is when a firm sells 2 or more products together for a single price. ^f715aa
- Cable televisions, streaming, software

```ad-example
Assume customers have the following maximum willingness to pay for two products.
![[Pasted image 20230216105816.png|400]]

Revenue from selling separately: $7\cdot 2 + 1\cdot 2 = 16$

Revenue from bundling: $8.5 \cdot 2 = 17$

Why? If sold separately, prices must be “**lowest** common denominators”. Each customer retains some consumer surplus

```

Bundling takes advantage of the fact that different customers have different **relative** **valuations** for **objects** in a bundle.
- Bundling **reduces** **dispersion** in reservation prices so firm can charge more and still sell to both customers
- Serve as a subtle form of price discrimination **WITHOUT** market segmentation

```ad-important
Pure bundling can be profitable if values (net of production costs) consumers place on the bundle are **less dispersed** than for the **individual goods**.
```
