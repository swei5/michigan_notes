### Moral Hazard

```ad-important
**Definition 14.1**: Moral Hazard

Moral hazard occurs when an entity has **incentive** to **increase** its **exposure to risk** because it does not bear the full costs of that risk.
- It is hidden behaviors or actions taken by one side of the transaction that the other side **CANNOT** **monitor** or **control** sufficiently to align incentives
```

In other words, when you contract with people whose actions you cannot “perfectly” observe (or evaluate or “monitor”), they may take advantage of you.

Moral Hazard examples include
- Individuals may use more services once insured (medication, tests, etc.)
- Car owners may spend less on maintenance if they have a warranty

#### Principal-Agent Problem
This boils down to what's known as the **principal-agent problem**, where one party (“principal”) is contracting with another party (“agent”) who:
1. Has more **information**
2. Has **incentive** to act in their own **interests** (as opposed to interest of principal)

Examples include
- Insurance company (principal) & insured person (agent)
- Managers (principals) & employees (agents)
- Homeowner (principal) & contractor (agent)
- Stockholders (principals) & CEO/management (agents)
- Franchisor (principal) & franchisee (agent)

#### Partial Solutions
- **Monitor your agent**: Fixed payment or salary; supervise your workers, contractor, etc.
	- Likely effects: shirking, adverse selection, monitoring costs
- **Align incentives**: “Sharing” contract with some monitoring, deductibles
	- Likely effects: some shirking; hard to find right “**share**”
- **Align incentives** **with** **pay**: with incentive pay: Pay based on performance
	- Likely effects: need to compensate **extra** for **risk** and **uncertainty** in income
		- Can backfire - If goals go up as performance increases, employees will **resist increasing effort**
		- More risky to the employee
		- Must define performance appropriately and objectively

### Asymmetric Information

```ad-summary
**Moral hazard**: hidden **actions**. Tendency for individuals to take actions that affect the costs and benefits of transacting with them.
- Solutions: monitoring, align incentives

**Adverse selection**: hidden characteristics. More low-quality goods in the market. 
- Solutions: forced pooling, screening, signaling
```

#### Risk Profiles

^5e10a5

- **Risk Neutral**: a person who is **indifferent** between a certain outcome and uncertain outcomes with the same expected value 
	- Focus only on **expected return**
	- Assumption for most firms
- **Risk Loving**: a person who prefers uncertain outcomes over a certain outcome with the same expected value
- **Risk Averse**: a person who prefers a certain outcomes over uncertain outcomes with the same expected value
	- Care about **expected return** and **variance**

To avoid risk, a risk averse person is willing to pay a **risk premium**. A risk-averse person will require **extra compensation** to get them to accept a risk.
