### Moral Hazard

```ad-important
**Definition 14.1**: Moral Hazard

Moral hazard occurs when an entity has **incentive** to **increase** its **exposure to risk** because it does not bear the full costs of that risk.
- It is hidden behaviors or actions taken by one side of the transaction that the other side **CANNOT** **monitor** or **control** sufficiently to align incentives
```

In other words, when you contract with people whose actions you cannot “perfectly” observe (or evaluate or “monitor”), they may take advantage of you.

Moral Hazard examples include
- Individuals may use more services once insured (medication, tests, etc.)
- Car owners may spend less on maintenance if they have a warranty

#### Principal-Agent Problem
This boils down to what's known as the **principal-agent problem**, where one party (“principal”) is contracting with another party (“agent”) who:
1. Has more **information**
2. Has **incentive** to act in their own **interests** (as opposed to interest of principal)

Examples include
- Insurance company (principal) & insured person (agent)
- Managers (principals) & employees (agents)
- Homeowner (principal) & contractor (agent)
- Stockholders (principals) & CEO/management (agents)
- Franchisor (principal) & franchisee (agent)

#### Partial Solutions
- **Monitor your agent**: Fixed payment or salary; supervise your workers, contractor, etc.
	- Likely effects: shirking, adverse selection, monitoring costs
- **Align incentives**: “Sharing” contract with some monitoring, deductibles
	- Likely effects: some shirking; hard to find right “**share**”
- **Align incentives** **with** **pay**: with incentive pay: Pay based on performance
	- Likely effects: need to compensate **extra** for **risk** and **uncertainty** in income
		- Can backfire - If goals go up as performance increases, employees will **resist increasing effort**
		- More risky to the employee
		- Must define performance appropriately and objectively
