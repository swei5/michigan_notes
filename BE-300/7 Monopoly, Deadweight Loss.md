### Market Structure
- Perfect competition: many firms, no market power, price takers
- Monopoly: only one firm, full market power, “price maker”
- In between: oligopoly, few firms with some market power. Have to think about strategic interactions

Note that $PS=R-VC$. Producer Surplus is simply **operating profit**. 
- The are under the $MC$ curve is $VC$ as $\frac{\partial{VC(Q)}}{\partial{Q}}=MC(Q)$

### Market Welfare
Total welfare is the sum of PS and CS.
- Maximized under **perfect competition** with no price controls or taxes

#### Dead-weight loss
**Net reduction** in total surplus from action that alters market equilibrium resulting in loss of surplus by one group that is not offset by gain to another group.
