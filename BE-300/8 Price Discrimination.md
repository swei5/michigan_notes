### Price Discrimination
Charging **different prices** to **different customers** for same good or for different units of good without cost differences is called price discrimination.

Price discrimination **increases** **profit** relative to single-price strategy by charging some existing customers more or selling more units.

In the scenario above, we can't sell between $Q_m$ and $Q_c$ without lowering the price. This leads to a deadweight loss.

#### Conditions for Price Discrimination
- Firm has market power and can prevent resale
	- NO arbitrage possible
	- Easy for **services** and when **transaction costs** are high
- Firm has knowledge about customer types
	- Local vs. Non-local
		- E.g. Disney charges differently for in-state (FL) and out-of-state visitors
	- Age
		- E.g. Education/Senior pricing
	- Time of purchase
		- E.g. When a customer needs an item immediately
- Managing public opinion

#### Types of Price Discrimination
- First‐degree (perfect) price discrimination: firm knows **EACH** individual buyer’s valuation of the good, and **charges** **exactly** that valuation

- Second‐degree (indirect or self-selected) price discrimination: firm uses **different tiers** of pricing based on quality or quantity purchased
	- A firm offers a menu of pricing options and allows customers to choose which option they prefer
		- Firm has **market power**
		- There are multiple types of customers
		- Firm does not have to know type of each customer
	- Inter-temporal
	- Coupons (e.g. coupons for lower income customers)
	- Versioning (e.g. airlines)
	- Quantity discounts

- Third‐degree (direct) price discrimination, or discrimination by **indicators**/**segments**: firm charges different prices by market segment (age, income, type of use, time of purchase)
