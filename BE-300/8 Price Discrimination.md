### Price Discrimination
Charging **different prices** to **different customers** for same good or for different units of good without cost differences is called price discrimination.

In the scenario above, we can't sell between $Q_m$ and $Q_c$ without lowering the price. This leads to a deadweight loss.

#### Conditions for Price Discrimination
- Firm has market power and can prevent resale
	- NO arbitrage possible
	- Easy for **services** and when **transaction costs** are high
- Firm has knowledge about customer types
	- Local vs. Non-local
		- E.g. Disney charges differently for in-state (FL) and out-of-state visitors
	- Age
		- E.g. Education/Senior pricing
	- Time of purchase
		- E.g. When a customer needs an item immediately
- Managing public opinion
