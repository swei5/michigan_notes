### Tying
A pricing strategy in which a seller will only sell a product to a buyer if that buyer also purchases another product from the seller.
- Way to charge different prices to different consumers according to their **intensity** of use
- Might have **monopoly** in **ONE** market (base good) and not the other (variable good). Tying goods together allows monopolist to **capture more surplus**
- Printers, E-Books, gaming consoles

Recall the definition of bundling ![[9 Indirect Price Discrimination, Bundling#^f715aa]]
Both bundling and tying are forms of price discrimination.
- Tied goods are typically **strong** **complements** (printer and ink), whereas bundled goods need not be complements (TV channels)
- Tied goods are typically sold **one to many** (one printer and lots of ink), whereas bundled goods are typically sold **one-to-one** (one burger and one order of fries)

#### Tying in Practice
Usually a **base good** plus a **variable good**.
- Base good is usually priced at **marginal cost**, variable good is typically priced **far above** marginal cost
