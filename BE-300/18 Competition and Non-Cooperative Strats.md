### Games, Recap
- Coordination Game
	- Multiple Nash equilibria - players want to coordinate their strategies
		- Move first with a credible **strategic** commitment and turn it into a **sequential game**
		- [[17 Repeated Games#^cb81d6|Tacit collusion]]

### Competition
In light of a competition, a player can do the following
- ~~Differentiate (quality, service, niche player)
- Fight (strategic actions in entry deterrence)
	- Dramatically **increase production** and **lower prices**, sacrificing profits but causing entrant to make losses.
	- E.g. predatory pricing, capacity expansion, raise competitors costs
- Accommodate (relinquish market share)
	- **Keep prices** relatively high, **preserving some profits** but letting entrant obtain significant market share
- ~~Price cooperatively (tacitly)
	- Repeated play allows for commitments and punishment

In this section we will focus on **strategic entry deterrence**.

#### Predatory Pricing
Drop price and incur **short-run losses** until rival leaves industry. Then **raise price** to recoup losses.

There are a few ways to deter entry of competitors.
- Capacity expansion
	- Ready to price-cutting if entrants enter
	- Might prevent potential entrant from entering in first place
	- Need to be careful of anticompetitive issues

The **decision to enter** or not for an entrant depends on where the incumbent's **optimal decision** lies. Again, this is based on the premise that all information is available to market participants.

In this scenario, the entrant should choose to enter since the optimal decision for the in
