### Block Pricing
- Conditions: firms do **NOT** know customer types, customers can all be identical or different, but firms must be capable of **preventing resale**
- Example using a step function:

Why is block pricing successful in getting more money out of people's pockets?

Single-price monopoly
- $CS'$: $\text{White Triangle}$
- $PS'$: $A$

Block pricing monopolist
- $CS$: $CS'+B+D$
- $PS$: $A+C+E$

```

#### Steps to Block Pricing
1. Find demand, inverse demand, $MR,MC$
2. Determine quantity at each pricing level
3. Calculate $CS,PS$
4. Calculate profit
5. Calculate total revenue and total costs

### Network
Product becomes more useful to consumers the more other people are using it.
- Each new user gets **private benefits** but also generates **network externalities** for existing users

```ad-important
**Definition 12.1**: Externalities

- **Positive externality**: value of good to a consumer grows as number of units sold increases
- **Negative externalities**: demand by others diminishes customerâ€™s own use/experience
```

#### Types of Network Effects
For a network to succeed, it has to achieve a critical mass of users.
- **Direct network benefit** from a larger network
	- E.g. ATMs, number of users on dating site
- **Indirect network benefit** from complementary goods that are offered when a product has a critical mass of users
	- E.g. variety of apps on platform, electric vehicle charging stations

Because of need for a **critical mass** of customers in a market with a positive network externality, we sometimes see only **ONE** large firm surviving.
- **Typical strategy**: charge a low introductory price at first and make it up later
