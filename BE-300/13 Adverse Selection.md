### Asymmetric Information
- Uncertainty can be result of an action taken by another individual who is behaving in a strategic fashion  
- More **informed parties** in a transaction can take advantage of less informed parties through price **discrimination**, selling **bad** products, engaging in **risky** behavior...  
- Quality of goods or services (or quality of buyers) may **erode** over time 

### Adverse Selection
- Occurs when one party is **better informed** about risks or quality than the other
	- E.g. In insurance markets individuals with highest expected losses will be most inclined to buy a lot of it

```ad-example
Example: The Insurance Death Spiral

Assume people differ in their probability of a loss or accident, and the insurer  
(e.g., vision plan, dental plan) cannot tell ex-ante who is high risk and who is  
low risk  
- As premium rises, relatively healthy want to leave. This makes premium rise  more and pool of existing insured get more expensive. This causes more  relatively healthy people to leave...  
- Eventually, only most sick remain in insurance pool and premiums are very,  very high.  
- Insurance market can eventually fail. Economists call this a “Death Spiral”
```

```ad-important
**Definition 13.1**: **Adverse Selection**

Before a transaction takes place, more informed person in transaction takes advantage of less informed person through something less informed person doesn’t know about.
```

Adverse selection can generate problems in markets: Party with **LESS** **information** (either buyer or seller) has to **base** their willingness to pay (if buying) or their price (if selling) on average quality or risk
- Sellers with high-quality goods don't sell, buyers with high risk aversion don't buy
	- Overtime, quality of goods for sale goes down, risk in the pool goes up

##### Zombie App Case
While most lemons market/adverse selection examples we saw in class end up with 0 quantity for **high type** (market for high-quality collapses) this is **NOT** necessarily the case.
- Freemium - ways to reveal and signal that the product is of **high type**
- Consumer belief about proportions of high and low quality products
	- However, consumers may update their belief
		- The bad *drives out* the good - high type producers cannot fully benefit from being high quality, so they produce less, whereas low type producers produce more - this inherently causes consumers to update their belief

If supply curves have **same intercept**, iterate once with updating beliefs to see if you end up in an **equilibrium** ($\text{consumer beliefs} = \text{actual proportions supplied}$).

#### Mitigating Adverse Selection
- Force everyone into market
	- E.g. insurance - **Affordable Care Act**
		- Lowers average risk in the pool, which lowers premiums/costs
