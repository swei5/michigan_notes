### Hold-Up Problem
Two firms want to trade with each other but one firm must **move first** by making a specific investment that can only be used in its transaction with the 2nd firm, and 2nd firm **takes advantage** of the 1st firm.
- Firm 1 is reluctant to make investments **WITHOUT protection** for their investments. 1st firm anticipates the 2nd mover will engage in opportunistic behavior

The solution to this problem is to have a contract between firm 1 and firm 2.
- If contracts are unavailable, firm 1 **WILL NOT** invest and both firms lose - *hold-up*
- Potentials for **moral hazard** - firm 2 might be reluctant to write this contract

#### Solving Hold-Ups
- Contracts
- Vertical integration
	- E.g. acquisition/purchase of components
- Reputation
- Diversify supply chains
