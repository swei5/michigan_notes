### Games, Recap
- Coordination Game
	- Multiple Nash equilibria - players want to coordinate their strategies
		- Move first with a credible **strategic** commitment and turn it into a **sequential game**
		- [[17 Repeated Games#^cb81d6|Tacit collusion]]

### Competition
In light of a competition, a player can do the following
- ~~Differentiate (quality, service, niche player)
- Fight (strategic actions in entry deterrence)
	- Dramatically **increase production** and **lower prices**, sacrificing profits but causing entrant to make losses.
	- E.g. predatory pricing, capacity expansion, raise competitors costs
- Accommodate (relinquish market share)
	- **Keep prices** relatively high, **preserving some profits** but letting entrant obtain significant market share
- ~~Price cooperatively (tacitly)
	- Repeated play allows for commitments and punishment

In this section we will focus on **strategic entry deterrence**.

#### Predatory Pricing
Drop price and incur **short-run losses** until rival leaves industry. Then **raise price** to recoup losses.

There are a few ways to deter entry of competitors.
- Capacity expansion
	- Ready to price-cutting if entrants enter
	- Might prevent potential entrant from entering in first place
	- Need to be careful of anticompetitive issues

The **decision to deter** depends on where the incumbent's **optimal decision** lies. Again, this is based on the premise that all information is available to market participants.

```ad-example
In this scenario, the entrant should choose to **enter** since the optimal decision for the incumbent will be to accomodate.

However, in the following scenario, they will not enter given the incumbent's decision.

```

Let's provide an example in more general terms.

```ad-example
Provided this scenario, the incumbent has the ability to decide whether to prevent entry of a rival by paying a fee of $b$; then, the potential rival decides whether to enter, upon a fee of $F$.

![[Pasted image 20230413105050.png|500]]

There are three possible outcomes
- Blockaded entry: $F>4$
	- Rivals will stay out. Payoffs are $(10,0)$
- Deterred entry: $F<4 \land b<6$
	- Potential rival will enter unless the incumbent pays the exclusivity fee. Payoffs are $(10-b,0)$
- Accomodated entry: $F<4 \land b>6$
	- Potential rival will enter and incumbent will not deter since the fee $b$ is too high. Payoffs are $(4, 4-F)$
```

```ad-summary
**Strategic commitments** can be critically valuable in the pursuit of non- cooperative aims, i.e. to deter or discourage entry

There are two cases:
1. When entry **CANNOT** be deterred
	- There is no point wasting resources trying to prevent entry
2. When strategy can deter entry
	- Market conditions allow such that entry is likely to occur **AND** it is profitable for incumbents to do so

```
