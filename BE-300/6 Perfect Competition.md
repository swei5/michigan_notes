Pricing strategies are dependent upon market structures.

### Key Assumptions
1. Infinitely many buyers and sellers
2. Zero-cost entry, exit
3. Identical goods (perfect substitutes)
4. Full information
5. Zero transaction cost

With these hold, buyers and sellers are said to be **price takers**.

### Demand
- No one will buy your product if you raise your price **above** going rate
- Can sell as much as you want to at **current price** without affecting price
	- Firms are **SMALL**
- When there are many good substitutes, individual firm's demand curve will be **flat**
- Realistic?

#### Firm and Market Demand Curve

- Single firm's choice of quantity $(q)$ will **NOT** affect market price. Firm's demand curve is flat.
- Market demand is **NOT** flat for a competitive industry, even though each firm's curve **IS** flat.
- The incremental revenue ($MR$) from selling one more unit is now $P$.
	- $MR=P$ in perfect competition

### Supply

- $Q$ is where $MC$ intersects $P=MR$
- Firm's $MC$ traces out quantity produced at each price $P$
- For $P<AVC$, supply curve is at $Q=0$
	- Firms shut down in the short run

Short-run **supply curve** of individual firm in PC market is section of $MC$ curve above $AVC$.

#### Market Supply
Market supply in short run is just **horizontal sum** of firm-level supply curves (above $AVC$)

### Entry and Exit
In the short run,
- Possible to make economic profit
- Profit encourages **MORE** firms to enter
	- Supply shifts to right

#### Operating Decision (Short Run)
- Output decision
	- Sell all units when $MR>MC$
- Shutdown decision
	- Shut down if $P<AVC$
