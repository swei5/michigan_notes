### Two-part Tariffs

```ad-important
**Definition 11.1**: **Two-part Tariff**

A common pricing strategy that has a **per-unit price** and a **fixed fee**. To employ a two-part tariff, a firm needs **market power**, **information** about  
consumer’s demand curves but consumers can be identical or different
```

Examples include mobile service plans, gyms, clubs, subscriptions.

We set $P=MC$ in order to sell $Q_c$ units (maximum).
- To make up for the loss we've made in $[Q_m, Q_c]$, we charge a fixed fee at the cost of $A+B+C$.


#### Two-Part Tariff with Different Demands
- Customers whose demands **CAN** be identified
	- Simply charge **different** fixed fee (based on $CS$) and the **same** per-unit price ($MC$)
- Customers whose demands **CAN'T** be identified
	- Since we cannot verify types. No one would choose to pay higher fee. Note similarity between this and [[9 Indirect Price Discrimination, Bundling#^30fab2|quantity discount|]].
	- Fee is constrained by type with **lower demand**

However, we have a neat trick.

When you cannot distinguish the two consumer types, then (using calculus) can show that profits will go up if you **increase** **per unit price** $P$ above $MC$ and then charge “remaining” CS of the low-demand type to both.
- Higher per unit price **captures** some of the $CS$ of the **high-demand type** when you cannot do it by charging those customers their own higher FF
	- This is price discrimination because average price per unit varies with number of units purchased

In general, Two-part tariff works if demands are different but not “too different.” If demands are very different, charge $P = MC$ and set $FF = CS$ for the **high demand group** (i.e.  abandon the low demand group)
