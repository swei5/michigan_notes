### Machine Learning
What is Machine Learning?

```ad-important
**Definition 1.1**: A computer program is said to learn from experience $E$ with respect to some class of tasks $T$, and performance measure $P$, if its performance at tasks in $T$, as measured by $P$, improves with experience $E$.
```

Take iPhone's FaceID as an example.

```ad-example
$T$: Binary Classification

$E$: Face Datasets

$P$: Number of successful unlocks

```

#### Issues
- Noises
- Datasets that are used in training
- Bias

#### Course Roadmap
We will learn about **theory** and **implementations** of machine learning algorithms.
- First half: **supervised learning** (regression, classification, etc.)
- Second half: **unsupervised learning** (clustering, density estimation, etc.)

```ad-warning
Be prepared for coding-heavy and math-heavy assignments. Use lots of linear algebra and probability theory.
```
