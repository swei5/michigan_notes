### Cloud
**Motivation**: how to scale the a web app to many, millions of users? 
- We need a production environment
- What we've done in the past is soxlely on one computer in a development environment

**Development environment** runs on one computer, sometimes just one program
- Example: `flask run`
**Production environment**, however, is many programs running on many computers for end users.
- Specialized and scalable

**Problem**: Where do these computers go?
**Solution**: Buy servers AKA "private cloud", or "on premise servers"
- Buy servers
