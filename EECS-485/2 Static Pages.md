### HTML
Web pages are written in HTML, browser translates it to what you see.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>  # Indicating this is HTML
<head>
	<title>Web page</title>  # Each tag needs to be opened/closed
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Hello world!</h1>
</body>
```

Other common HTML tags we've seen include
- `<a href="google.com">some text</a>`
	- Here `href` is an **attribute** of tag `<a>`
- `<h1>`, ..., `<h6>`
- `<p>`
	- Paragraph, starts a new line
- `<ul>`
