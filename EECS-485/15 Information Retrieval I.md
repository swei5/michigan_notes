### Search
Let's take searching on Google as an example.
- Ahead of time, Google
	- Downloads the internet, and
	- Build an index
- At run time
	- Use index
	- Rank results
	- Do it really fast and return results to client

Ranking is **important**!
- 33% of clicks on **top result**
- Two methods
	- Use words on the page
	- Use links on the page
		- Google's own innovation

### Boolean Retrieval
For each document (webpage), there are two possible outcomes of query processing.
- `TRUE` or `FALSE`
- Exact match retrieval - are the words on the page or not
- Simplest form of search and **used to be most common**
