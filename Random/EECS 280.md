### Questions
1. How does the weekly routine look like for this job?
2. What are some of the projects past IA have undertaken, if there is any?
3. What motivates you to teach?


### Suggestions
1. More coding practices - this is a course that's essentially about programming
	- Polymorphism
	- Data structures
	- ADTs, Compound objects
		- Big 3
2. A better mega set-up

### Why 
#### Personal
- Teaching is a way to help myself solidify the knowledge I learned. Especially for 280 cause there are so many new concepts that up until today I'm not even able to fully digest. Coding in one sense is easy - the more lines of code I read and write, the better I'm when I encounter a similar question

#### Course
- I love the course but lots of people don't. I want to make everyone who's taking this class if I were to teach enjoy the content

- I'm no genius so I understand the conventional thought process of students cause I've been through there, I was in their shoes once. Taken the standard EECS sequence and felt pretty solid in terms of grasping the knowledge and would like to pass that on to many others.
