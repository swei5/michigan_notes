Don't use a tab when you write.

To create a new paragraph, simply put a **new line** in between the two paragraphs.
This won't create a paragraph.<br>
Typing `\<br>` will create a new line, but not a new paragraph.

Use **Two asterisks** to bolden characters. In fact, Command + B will do the trick. <br>
Use *Single asterisk* to italicize characters. In fact, Command + I will do the trick as per usual.  ***This works as well!* ^910f99

To indicate something is a code, wrap it in \`. Like this: `root == nullptr;`

To create a code block, wrap the block in 3 \`s.
```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
	std::cout << "Hello World\n";
	return 0;
}
```
