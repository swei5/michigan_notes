[[2024-04-15]] #Database #DBMS 

```ad-todo
Roadmap of DBMS:
- ~~Disk Manager~~
- ~~Access Methods~~
- ~~Operator Execution~~
- ~~Query Planning~~
- ~~Transaction Manager~~
- **Log Manager**
```

Motivation: in the case of database failure, how do we inform the client of **committed changes that were NOT COMMUNICATED** to the disk.
