### Overview
- *Traditional RDBMS* 
	- Most focus on this course
- **NoSQL**
	- Key-value stores (hash tables)
	- Document stores (MongoDB)
	- MapReduce (similar to `GROUP BY` in SQL)
- Modern RDBMS (performance improvement strategies, based on workload)
	- In-memory DBs
	- Columnar DBs (DuckDB)
	- Approximate DBs

### NoSQL 
Not every data problem is best solved by traditional relational databases: NoSQL stands for **not only SQL**.
- Still supports SQL languages
