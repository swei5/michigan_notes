### Stock Basics

```ad-important
**Definition 6.1.1**: Stocks

Stock is a share of ownership in the firm which entitles the owner to:
- Receive dividends  
- Vote at shareholder meetings    
- Request financial information from the company

**Common vs. preferred stock**
- Common shareholders have **NO** particular entitlement to a dividend
- Preferred shareholders receive a specified **dividend**, unless there isn’t enough cash to repay the lenders
```

How cash is returned to shareholders:
- Dividends - distribution of profits
	- Regular dividend - scheduled dividend paid **every quarter**
	- Special dividend - **one-time** distribution of cash to shareholders
- Share repurchases
	- Buy-backs from investors either on or off the market

Most listed firms pay dividends **and** repurchase shares.
- Stocks that pay dividends are generally perceived as **less risky** than those that don’t.
- 50/50 split between dividend payouts and repurchases in cash return

```ad-important
**Definition 6.2.2**: Ratios
- The **dividend payout ratio** is the ratio of the total amount of dividends paid out to shareholders relative to the net income of the company.
$$\text{Dividend Payout Ratio}=\frac{D}{NI}$$

- The **total payout ratio** is the pay out on dividends and share repurchases.
$$\text{Total Payout Ratio}=\frac{D+\text{Repurchases}}{NI}$$
```

#### Residual Claim
Equity is a “residual” claim. "Residual" just means the **equity holder** doesn't get paid **UNTIL** **everybody** else gets paid.
$$\text{Market Value of Equity}=\max(\text{Market Value of Assets}-\text{Debt},0)$$

Most of the time, **book value** of debt is a reasonable proxy for market value of debt.

```ad-warning
Never use the book value of equity as a proxy for the market value of equity.
- The market cap indicates what the **market** thinks the equity is worth; the book value of equity is what the **accountant** thinks it should be in light of existing accounting standards.

#### Valuation Intro, Public and Private Companies
In general, our valuation approaches for publicly-traded companies and private firms are the **SAME**.
- We use:
	- Discounted cash flow
		- Free cash flow
		- Dividend discount model
	- Valuation multiples
		- P/E
		- Enterprise value/EBITDA
		- Enterprise value/EBIT
		- Enterprise value/Sales
- We estimate
	- Market value
	- Intrinsic value

```ad-note
However, we still make **downward** adjustments to private company valuations for
- Lack of liquidity
- Potential conflicts of interest between controlling shareholders and minority shareholders

In fact, estimating the market value of a publicly-traded company is way simpler - just use the **last traded price**.

#### Stock Market
Stock markets include
- New York Stock Exchange (**NYSE**) 
- National Association of Securities Dealers Adjusted Quote (**NASDAQ**)
- London Stock Exchange (**LSE**)
- Australian Securities Exchange (**ASX**)

Investors are willing to pay a **premium** for **liquidity**, price **transparency**, and **consistency** of information.
- However, the listings do not eliminate the risk that investors make based upon unreliable information

It's also noteworthy that companies stay private because
- Clear lines of communication between management
- Less constraints and distraction
- Disclosure of information could be used by competitors
