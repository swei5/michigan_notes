### Portfolio Management
Our investment objectives are
1. Identify the set of portfolios that offer the **highest expected return** at **EACH** level of risk
2. Select a portfolio for the investor that aligns with the investor’s **risk preferences**

Risk is measured by SD of portfolio returns on a forward-looking basis.

#### Expected Returns
The mean is a **probability-weighted** average of possible outcomes.$$\mathbb{E}(R)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_{i}x_{i}$$
where $p_{i}$ is the probability of event $i$ and $x_{i}$ is the expected return of event $i$. 

The variance is therefore $$\text{Var}(R)=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}p_{i}(x_{i}-\mathbb{E}(R))^{2}$$

Sometimes, if we use a **sample of past data** to estimate the mean, each observation is considered to represent **equal probability**. This is **time series data**, which is a specific application: $$\mathbb{E}(R)=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{T}x_{i}}{T}$$

The variance of time series data has to taken into account sample bias: $$\text{Var}(R)=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{T}(x_{i}-\mathbb{E}(R))^{2}}{T-1}$$

### Portfolio Risk and Return

```ad-important
**Definition 8.1.1**: Expected Return, Variance of Portfolio

Given the return of a portfolio $p$ such that $\mathbf{R}=[r_{1}, r_{2},\cdots, r_{n}]$, weight $\mathbf{w}$, and standard deviation $\mathbf{\sigma}$, the expected return on a portfolio is a **weighted average** of the expected returns on **EACH asset** in the portfolio. $$\mathbb{E}(\mathbf{R})=\sum\limits_{i} w_{i}\mathbb{E}(r_{i})$$

The variance of portfolio returns is a **weighted sum** of the **covariance of returns** on **EACH pair** of assets. $$\text{Var}(\mathbf{R})=\sum_{i} \sum_{j} w_{i}w_{j}\sigma_{ij}\sigma_{i}\sigma_{j}= w^{T}\times \Sigma \times w=\sum\limits_{i,j, i\ne j}w_{i}w_{j}\sigma_{ij}+\sum\limits_{i,j, i=j}w_{i}^{2}\sigma_{i}^{2}$$

The weights are the proportions of asset allocation. $\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix and $w$ is the weight vector and $\sigma_{ij}$ is the covariance of asset $i$, $j$.

Why do we appreciate a portfolio rather than a single stock?
- By combining assets that behave *differently* from each other, portfolios can provide higher **risk-adjusted** returns.
	- The investment returns have less than perfect correlation $\set{1,-1}$

#### Covariance and Correlation

```ad-important
**Definition 8.1.2**: Covariance

Covariance is the average of the product of each stocks’ deviation from the mean.$$\text{Cov}(A,B)=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}p_{i}(x_{i}-\mathbb{E}(A))(y_{i}-\mathbb{E}(B))$$

In simple terms, this is the return on stock A minus the mean return for stock $A$ times return on stock B minus the mean return on stock $B$.

```ad-important
**Definition 8.1.3**: Correlation
Correlation of returns between 2 assets is covariance divided by the product of their standard deviations.$$\rho_{AB}=\text{Corr}(A,B)=\frac{\text{Cov}(A,B)}{\sigma_{A}\sigma_{B}}$$
```

This is important because the risk of a portfolio is determined by how much weight is assigned to assets or asset classes which have returns that **move together**.
- Higher covariances of assets, higher risks
- With a well **diversified** portfolio we will be less concerned about whether one **individual** asset goes up or down

To compute the covariance of a portfolio returns, we must construct the **variance-covariance matrix** $C$ of size $n \times n$ with $n$ assets.  Note that $$[C]_{ij}=w_{i}w_{j}\text{Cov}(R_{i},R_{j})$$ and $$[C]_{ii}=w_{i}^{2}\text{Var}(R_{i})$$
where $w_{i}$ is the weight of asset $i$ in the portfolio.

To get the variance of return of our portfolio, this is simply $$\text{Var}(R)=\sum\limits_{i}\sum\limits_{j} [C]_{ij}$$

Below is a great chart demonstrating why portfolios are superior.

A well diversified portfolio will typically have 50 to 100 assets, possibly 500 (S&P 500).
- Using different weights yield different results
