After learning about how risk and return for a portfolio are defined: ![[8.1 Portfolio Theory#^b85381]]
We want to ask, what return is **fair compensation** for risk?

#### Efficient Frontier
First, let us first consider a world with many risky assets: Again, we can combine these assets in **portfolios** and calculate expected return and standard deviation.

![[Pasted image 20230405154830.png|400]]
All risk-return **combinations** form the **Opportunity Set** (light blue curve and every portfolio and asset within this curve).

```ad-important
**Definition 8.2.1**: CAPM, Important Definitions

- The **Minimum Variance Portfolio** (MVP) is the portfolio with the **lowest** **variance** (risk)
- The **Efficient Frontier** starts at the **MVP** and is generated by different **efficient portfolios**

![[Pasted image 20230405155037.png|400]]
```

A portfolio is **efficient** when the **return** is **maximized** given the portfolio standard deviation.
- Note that portfolios that lie **below** the **Efficient Frontier** are inefficient, given there exists some portfolio with higher return and same risk

Let's use a real world example to illustrate such idea.

![[Pasted image 20230405155458.png|600]]
The **investment opportunity set** is all the red portfolios plus the 3 individual assets.
- First, note that no one will buy Boeing given our reasoning above
- The **Efficient Frontier** are the green dots (including Nike itself)
	- These portfolios offer the highest expected return for each level of risk
		- $\max(R_{i}|\sigma^{2}_{i})$
		- $\min(\sigma_{i}^{2}|R_{i})$

The portfolio choice depends upon personal **risk preference**.
- If we considered more stocks and more portfolios, we may shift the efficient frontier

---

### Diversification, Systematic Risk
The **variance of a portfolio** with many assets is determined mostly by the **covariance terms**.
- If the covariances of the stocks in a portfolio are high, we **CANNOT** **reduce** the **risk** of the portfolio much

Diversification can substantially **reduce the variability** of portfolio returns without an **equivalent reduction** in expected returns.
- Intuitively, this reduction in arises because worse than expected returns from one asset are offset by better than expected returns from other assets
- However, there is a **minimum level of risk** that cannot be diversified away, known as **systematic** or **non-diversifiable risk**

![[Pasted image 20230405160511.png|500]]

```ad-important
**Definition 8.2.2**: Systematic, Unsystematic Risk

**Systematic risk** is any risk that affects the financial market **as a whole**. Systematic risk **CANNOT** be eliminated through diversification since it is a nonspecific risk that affects the entire market.
- E.g. uncertainties in macroeconomy, interest rates, inflation, policies

**Unsystematic risk** is the risk that is unique to a specific company. It can be eliminated through diversification.
- E.g. company announcements, patents, revenues, costs
```

For well diversified portfolios, the unsystematic risk is very small.
- The total risk of a well diversified portfolio is almost **equivalent to** the systematic risk

### CAPM, Assumptions
CAPM assumes **perfect capital market** with **ALL** investors having the same expectations.

```ad-important
**Definition 8.2.3**: CAPM Assumptions, Part I
1. All investors are **risk-averse**
2. One period - investors build their portfolios focusing on the returns they may get over **a single period**
3. Rational Expectations -  All investors **correctly interpret** any information they have
4. No impediments, constraints to trade - No liquidity problems, all assets are infinitely divisible
```

If all assumptions hold, then all investors end up forming the **same efficient frontier**.
- This is the **common efficient frontier**

```ad-important
**Definition 8.2.4**: CAPM Assumptions, Part II

All investors can borrow and lend at the **risk-free rate** of interest.
```

This is a theoretical concept but we need to make simplifying assumptions.
- Lending at the risk-free rate means a **positive** weight in the **risk-free asset**
- Borrowing at the risk-free rate means a **negative weight** in the **risk-free asset** ($w>1$ for the risky portfolio)
	- We **go short** on the **risky assets** in order to **go long** on the **risky portfolio**

Thus, we can now combine the risk-free asset with any risky portfolio to form a new two-asset portfolio – **a risk-free investment** and a **risky investment**. Intuitively,
$$\mathbb{E}(R)=\sum\limits_{i} w_{i}R_{i}$$
for investment type $i\in \text{\{risk-free, risky\}}$.

Note that our **covariance matrix** for the two-asset portfolio might look different, since $\sigma^{2}_{rf}=0$. Hence,
$$C=\begin{bmatrix}0 & 0\\0 &w_{r}^{2}\sigma^{2}_{r}\end{bmatrix}$$

Now we have a set of new portfolios we can form by combining the risk-free asset with the risky component of our portfolio.

![[Pasted image 20230406003502.png|500]]
All the points along the new efficient frontier are a **combination** of the **risk-free asset** and one particular **risky component**.

The risky portfolio that **dominates** all others will have the **highest [[7.2 Risk and Return Profile#^3624b7|Sharpe ratio]]**.

![[Pasted image 20230406005514.png]]
In this example, the bottom left has **positive** weight in the risk-free asset.
- More lending at the risk-free rate

The Upper right has **negative** weight in the risk-free asset.
- More borrowing at the risk-free rate

### CAPM, Explained
If our assumptions hold, moreover, there is **NO** benefit from trying to beat the market since all participants all have the **SAME** assumptions, no-one has an information advantage.

This lead to our optimal course of action - **diversification**.
- The most diversified portfolio is the **market portfolio**, held in proportion to their market value
	- Stock indices are proxies for a possibly theoretical market portfolio

```ad-note
This means that EVERYONE ends up with the same risky component of their portfolio – the market portfolio.
- Investors still hold different proportions of the market portfolio and **risk-free asset**, depending upon **risk preference**; however, the **risky component** is the **SAME** for everyone.

This is illustrated by the new, *linear* efficient frontier seen above. 
```

In this way, investors are exposed only to **systematic** market-related risk.
- CAPM states that only systematic risk is **compensated** in the form of a **higher expected return**, since all investors can easily **diversify** away the unsystematic risk

#### Model
Assume that investors allocate their wealth between the risk-free asset and a portfolio of risky assets, also called **tangency portfolio** or **market portfolio** $M$.
- $M$ is the portfolio that  guarantees the **best mean-variance** combinations
- All combinations of $M$ and $r_{F}$ lie on the **Capital Market Line**

![[Pasted image 20230406010806.png|400]]

As explained, every portfolio on the **Capital Market Line** has the same **Sharpe Ratio**, given that they are the most **efficient** investment. Then, we can calculate the Sharpe Ratio for the market portfolio: $$SR_{M}=\frac{\mathbb{E}(R_{M})-R_{F}}{\sigma_{M}}$$
In other words, the Sharpe ratio is a **reward-for-risk** ratio.

#### Pricing of Individual Assets
Since in the world of CAPM, the volatility of returns due to **asset-specific events** don’t matter (unsystematic risk). The only thing that matters for pricing purposes is how much a firm's returns **co-move** with the **market portfolio**. Then we can derive the following

```ad-important
**Definition 8.2.5**: CAPM, Pricing of Securities

Under the CAPM assumptions, the relationship between the expected return $\mathbb{E}(R_{i})$ of each security $i$ and the expected return of the Market Portfolio is given by $$\mathbb{E}(R_{i})=R_{F}+\beta_{i} (\mathbb{E}(R_{M}-R_{F}))$$

where $\mathbb{E}(R_{M}-R_{F})$ is the **market risk premium**, and $\beta_{i}$ of each security is given by $$\beta_{i}=\frac{\text{Cov}(R_{i},R_{M})}{\text{Var}(R_{M})}$$

Beta measures the **responsiveness** of a security to movements in the market portfolio - its **sensitivity to systematic risk**.
```

Below is a graph that illustrates our reasoning above.
- The market portfolio, $M$ has $\beta_M=1$
- The gap between expected market return and risk-free rate, $\mathbb{E}(R_{M}-R_{F})$, define the **security market line**
