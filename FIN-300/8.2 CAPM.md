After learning about how risk and return for a portfolio is defined: ![[8.1 Portfolio Theory#^b85381]]
We want to ask, what return is **fair compensation** for risk?

#### Efficient Frontier
First, let us first consider a world with many risky assets: Again, we can combine these assets in **portfolios** and calculate expected return and standard deviation.

![[Pasted image 20230405154830.png|400]]
All risk-return **combinations** form the **Opportunity Set** (light blue curve and every portfolio and asset within this curve).

```ad-important
**Definition 8.2.1**: CAPM, Important Definitions

- The **Minimum Variance Portfolio** (MVP) is the portfolio with the **lowest** **variance** (risk)
- The **Efficient Frontier** starts at the **MVP** and is generated by different **efficient portfolios**

![[Pasted image 20230405155037.png|400]]
```

A portfolio is **efficient** when the **return** is **maximized** given the portfolio standard deviation.
- Note that portfolios that lie **below** the **Efficient Frontier** are inefficient, given there exists some portfolio with higher return and same risk

Let's use a real world example to illustrate such idea.

![[Pasted image 20230405155458.png|600]]
The **investment opportunity set** is all the red portfolios plus the 3 individual assets.
- First, note that no one will buy Boeing given our reasoning above
- The **Efficient Frontier** are the green dots (including Nike itself)
	- These portfolios offer the highest expected return for each level of risk
		- $\max(R_{i}|\sigma^{2}_{i})$
		- $\min(\sigma_{i}^{2}|R_{i})$

The portfolio choice depends upon personal **risk preference**.
- If we considered more stocks and more portfolios, we may shift the efficient frontier

### Diversification, Systematic Risk
The **variance of a portfolio** with many assets is determined mostly by the **covariance terms**.
- If the covariances of the stocks in a portfolio are high, we **CANNOT** **reduce** the **risk** of the portfolio much

Diversification can substantially **reduce the variability** of portfolio returns without an **equivalent reduction** in expected returns.
- Intuitively, this reduction in arises because worse than expected returns from one asset are offset by better than expected returns from other assets
- However, there is a **minimum level of risk** that cannot be diversified away, known as **systematic** or **non-diversifiable risk**

```ad-important
**Definition 8.2.2**: Systematic, Unsystematic Risk

**Systematic risk** is any risk that affects the financial market **as a whole**. Systematic risk **CANNOT** be eliminated through diversification since it is a nonspecific risk that affects the entire market.
- E.g. uncertainties in macroeconomy, interest rates, inflation, policies

**Unsystematic risk** is the risk that is unique to a specific company. It can be eliminated through diversification.
- E.g. company announcements, patents, revenues, costs
```

For well diversified portfolios, the unsystematic risk is very small.
- The total risk of a well diversified portfolio is almost **equivalent to** the systematic risk

### CAPM, Assumptions
CAPM assumes **perfect capital market** with **ALL** investors having the same expectations.

```ad-important
**Definition 8.2.3**: CAPM Assumptions
1. All investors are **risk-averse**
2. One period - investors build their portfolios focusing on the returns they may get over **a single period**
3. Rational Expectations -  All investors **correctly interpret** any information they have
4. No impediments, constraints to trade - No liquidity problems, all assets are infinitely divisible
