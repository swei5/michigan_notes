### Overview, Value, Price, Yield

```ad-important
**Definition 5.1.1**: Bond

Bond is a security obligating the issuer to make payments of interest and principal to the bondholder at specified dates.
```

Basic Definitions:
| Term             | Definition                                                                                                                                       |     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --- |
| Maturity date    | Date when principal (loan) is fully paid off                                                                                                     |     |
| Term             | Time until maturity date                                                                                                                         |     |
| Face Value       | Principal amount of a loan                                                                                                                       |     |
| Price            | What two well-informed and willing investors are willing to exchange a bond for, typically the **last traded price** (different from Face Value) |     |
| Coupon Payment   | A payment to the bond holder specified in the contract between the issuer and the bond holder.                                                   |     |
| Zero-coupon Bond | A bond with zero coupon payments, AKA **pure discount bond**                                                                                     |     |                                                                                          |     |

```ad-note
Bond prices are often expressed as a **percent price** relative to a base of 100.  

For example, if the face value is $1,000 and the price is $1,050 the bond price could be quoted as 105 (that is, $1,050 ÷ $1,000 × 100 = 105)
```

```ad-important
**Definition 5.1.2**: Coupon Rate

A way of quoting the coupon payments as a percentage of face value.
- The coupon rate is quoted as an APR.

```

In the previous example, there is a coupon payment of $20 every six months, so $40 per year the coupon rate is $40 of coupon payments ÷ Face value of $1,000 = 4.00%.

The relationship between the **coupon payment** and the **coupon rate** can be expressed in the following equations:
$$\mathrm{Annual\ Coupon\ Payment}=\mathrm{Annual\ Coupon\  Rate}\cdot FV$$
$$\mathrm{Coupon\ Payment\ per\ Period}=\frac{\mathrm{Annual\ Coupon\  Rate}}{n}\cdot FV$$


```ad-important
**Definition 5.1.3**: Yield-to-Maturity (YTM)

The **rate of return** from holding the bond to maturity, if there is no default and all payments are made as promised.
```

We compute the yield to maturity as an [[3 Investment Decision Rules#^d8138a|Internal Rate of Return]]. “What return would set the present value of the promised cash flows equal to the price? ”

**Current yield** is the return from income on a bond, computed as **annual coupon payments** divided by price.

```ad-warning
The coupon rate, coupon payment, face value, timing of coupon payments and maturity date **DO NOT** **change** from day to day as the bond is being traded.

The price and yield to maturity **DO change** from day to day as the bond is being traded. Yield to maturity is just a way of writing the price as a projected return.
```

### Bond Valuation
The term “value” has two concepts:
- Market value, or price
	- What two investors willing and well-informed investors are **willing** to **exchange** an asset for
- Intrinsic value
	- An **estimate** of what an investor thinks is a **fair price** for the asset, given **projections** of potential **payoffs** and **risks**

Price is **NOT EQUAL** to intrinsic value as the expectations of the investors trading the asset are different from the expectations of someone estimating intrinsic value.
- We want to buy the assets that are trading at/below **intrinsic value**

```ad-important
**Definition 5.1.4**: Bond Valuation

In general, bond price follows the formulae below:
$$P=PV_{\mathrm{coupons}}+PV_{\mathrm{FV}}$$
```

^a866bd

Technically, the cash flows are not **expected cash flows** (there is some chance of **default**!). But we can still perform a valuation using these promised cash flows provided the discount rate **incorporates the risk** of default.

To compute the present value of **future coupon payments**, we have a **zero-growth annuity**. We will thus use the NPV formulae for the PV of coupon payments (expected cash flows): ![[2.2 Discounted Cash Flow II#^28bede]]
In this case, $C_1=C_i=\cdots=C_n$ is our fixed coupon payment, $g=0$, $T$ is number of payments, and $r$ is the discount rate provided. This is equivalent to
$$PV_{\mathrm{coupons}}=\frac{C}{r}\cdot\left(1-\left(\frac{1}{1+r}\right)^{T}\right)$$
To compute the present value of the **face value**, this is simply
$$PV_{FV}=\frac{FV}{(1+r)^T}$$ ^4ca547

```ad-example
If we are asked to compute the value of a bond at time $t$, where $t\notin \mathbb{Z}^+$, do the following:
1. Compute $P_{t^\prime}$, where $t^{\prime}=\mathrm{floor}(t)$
	- Note that $T'=n-t'$ as we have paid exactly $t$ coupon payments
2. Shift the valuation of $P_t$ forward by $t-t^{\prime}$
- $P_{t'}=P_{t}\cdot(1+r)^{N(t')}$
	- $N(k)$ indicates the **number of payments** after $t'$ time since the last coupon payment
```

### Yield to Maturity
Again, yield to maturity is a way of expressing price as a **rate of return**. This allows for **comparison** across bonds of prospective returns.
- However, the bond price doesn’t tell us anything compared to other bonds
- Most of the time quoted as an **APR**

Yield is a way of quoting **prices**.

```ad-example
- At 99.21, the prospective return on the Ford bond (the yield) is 5.00%.
- At 103.16, the prospective return on the GM bond (the yield) is 4.51%.

Is the Ford bond a better investment because of higher YTM? Not necessarily. Ford could have a higher yield because it is a **riskier** bond than the GM bond, or it could have a higher yield because investors have **mispriced** either the Ford or GM bond.
```

```ad-warning
Don't forget to translate **periodic rate** into **APR** after we've done the calculations!
```

### YTM and Price
Bond price and yields move in **opposite directions**.
- Intuition: since bond price is lower, the initial investment is smaller while the payoffs (coupon and principal) remain the same

- If $P=FV$ ^5a2fcb
	- The bond is trading **at par**
	- $\mathrm{coupon\ rate}=\mathrm{yield}$
		- Intuition: all *yields* of the bond come from coupons, not difference between face values and price
- If $P>FV$
	- The bond is trading **at a premium**
	- $\mathrm{coupon\ rate}>\mathrm{yield}$
		- Intuition: smaller yield as bond is priced higher, coupon rate remains unchanged
- If $P<FV$
	- The bond is trading **at a discount**
	- $\mathrm{coupon\ rate}<\mathrm{yield}$

---

### Zero Coupon Bonds
Zero coupon bonds are just like coupon paying bonds, but with one exception – coupons are zero.
- The **promised repayment** is simply the **repayment** of the **face value** at maturity.
- In the valuation of the bond, we simply leave out the coupon payments.
