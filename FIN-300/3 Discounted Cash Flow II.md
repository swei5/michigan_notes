### Multiple Cash Flows
Investments typically generate **multiple** cash flows.
- The value of an investment is the **present value** of all its **expected** **cash flows**.
	- Expectation is probability-weighted

```ad-example

We calculate the present value for each investment, and sum them up accordingly.

In this application, the cash flows are (usually) equally-spaced (1 year),  so we can use the Excel function `NPV (discount rate, cash flows)`.
-  However, we need to manually input cash flow at time `0`.
