### Stock Valuation
There are two types of values for stocks.

```ad-important
**Definition 6.2.1**: Market Value and Intrinsic Value

The **market value** of an asset – shares, firm, debt, project – is the **transaction** **price** between a buyer and seller who are well informed and willing to trade.
- Price is the market value

The **intrinsic value** of an asset is an estimate of what someone thinks is fair based upon an estimate of reasonable assumptions.
```

There are two primary ways of valuation:
- Discounted cash flow valuation
- Multiples valuation

Both techniques would allow us to estimate both the **intrinsic** and **market** value.

#### Discounted Cash Flow Valuation
Recall we have used this technique in almost evaluating **ANY** types of assets; bonds, for example: ![[5.1 Bonds I#^a866bd]]
uses a DCF model.

For stocks, there are two ways using DCFs:
	1. Estimate the enterprise value (entirety) of the firm: projecting the **free cash flow**, discounted at a rate, and **subtracting** the value of **debt**
1. Dividend discount model: estimate **dividends per share** and discount at a rate (the cost of equity)

```ad-note
The choice as to whether to use the free cash flow to the firm approach or the dividend discount model depends upon the **information** **available** for analysis.

Note that for either approach, the final valuation should be **exactly the same**.
```

##### Free Cash Flow
See the process below.

```ad-important
**Definition 6.2.2**: Free cash flow valuation model

First, we calculate the value of **operating assets**:
$$OA=PV_{CF, \text{expected}}=PV_{CF,\text{explicit forecast period}}+PV_{\text{terminal value}}$$

from which we obtain the **enterprise value**
$$EV=OA+\text{Non-operating Assets including Excess Cash}$$

Then, we get the **value of equity** as well as **equity value per share**:
$$EQV=EV-\text{Market Value of Debt}$$
$$P=EQVPS=\frac{EQV}{N}$$

where $N$ is the number of **shares outstanding**.

**Definition 6.2.3**: Excess Cash
Excess cash is cash that is **NOT** needed as **working capital** to generate the forecast cash flows. A company can **immediately** use the cash to
- Pay dividends
- Buy-back shares
- Repurchase shares

There is **NO** impact on the projected cash flows.
```

One trick to estimate **cash required to operate** the business is
- Differences between revenue and EBITDA (1/12 to 3/12 of annual **cash operating costs**)
	- However, this always varies by industry and firm

##### Dividend and Discount
Similar to free cash flow model, this technique projects dividends per share for **ALL future** periods, which might include
- An explicit forecast period
- A terminal growth period

```ad-important
**Definition 6.2.4**: Dividend discount model

In this model, we compute the **present value** of **dividends per share** using a **discount rate** that reflects the **risk to equity** (called “the cost of equity capital”)
- The cost of equity will be **higher** than the discount rate related to the **whole firm**
	- Equity is **riskier** than the whole business because of residual claimant

$$EQVPS=PV_{\text{explicit dividends},0\to i}+PV_{\text{forecasted dividends},i\to \infty}$$
```

#### Valuation Multiples
See below.

```ad-important
**Definition 6.2.5**: Valuation multiples:

There are six steps, in total:
1. Compile value multiples from **comparable firms**
	- Enterprise Value/Sales
	- Enterprise Value/EBITDA
	- Enterprise Value/EBIT
	- P/EPS
2. Find median multiples
	- Median of the measure in (1)
1. Compile financial information for the firm to be valued
2. Estimate **enterprise value**, **equity value** and **equity value per share** from all valuation multiples
3. Summarize valuation estimates
4. Reach a conclusion
```

Note that in step (4), we are using values from (2) to obtain enterprise value, equity value, and equity value per share of the firm we are analyzing.

```ad-example
For example, if median multiples for Enterprise Value/Sales is 2.69, and we have that the sales figure for firm $A$ is 11,595, then
$$\text{Enterprise}=2.69\cdot11595=31160$$

which allows us to get equity value and EVPS, respectively.
```

The same goes for other median multiples (which are just ratios).

In step 6, we want to consider a **weighted average approach**.
- Forecast information gives more **reliable valuation** estimates than historical information
- However, this runs the risk of **overestimating** because a median multiple can be as low as 0.

```ad-note
Some important factors to consider in conclusion:

- There is lots of estimation error in valuation so do not rely exclusively on one valuation multiple
- As you move up the income statement (towards sales) the information is less relevant but has less meaurement error
- As you move down the income statement (towards earnings per share) the information is more relevant but has more measurement error
- You could have information to suggest some firms are more comparable than others
```

### Important Ratios #Exam 
$$\text{Long-term Reinvestment Rate}=1-\frac{DPS_{n}}{EPS_{n}}$$
where $n$ is the last explicit forecast period.

$$g=\text{Long-term Return on Reinvestment}\cdot \text{Long-term Reinvestment rate}$$
where $g$ is long-term growth rate.

---
$$EV=EQVPS\cdot n+D$$
where $EVPS$ is the equity value per share of the stock (**intrinsic price net dividend**), $n$ is the number of shares on issue, and $D$ is the amount of debt the enterprise owes.

$$EPS=\frac{NI}{n}$$
$$EQVPS=EPS\cdot P/E$$
