### Normal Distribution
In this module, we assumed our return on investment $r\sim N(\mu, \sigma)$.
- In reality this assumption isn't true as there are often extreme events

Recall the definition of **standard normal distribution**.
$$Z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\sim N(0,1)$$

To get from area to $z$ -score, we can apply Excel formula `NORMDIST(area : float) -> z` .

### Risk and Return Profile of different Assets
In general, higher risk asset classes earn higher returns.
- This **might NOT** hold over the short run.

#### Equity Risk Premium
Recall the definition of (Equity) Risk Premium: ![[7.1 Investment Returns#^8d917d]]
- The World Ex-US average risk premium is about 4%
- The U.S. average risk premium is about 7%.

However, stocks listed in one particular country have happened to earn high returns in the past does **NOT** necessarily mean this will persist in the future.
- Due to **industry differences**, **innovations**, and **market conditions**

Still, historical return is still a useful starting point.

**Definition 7.2.1**: Sharpe Ratio

The Sharpe ratio of a portfolio is the portfolioâ€™s risk premium divided by its standard deviation.
$$S_a=\frac{\mathbb{E}(R-R_b)}{\sigma_{a}}$$

The Sharpe ratio is a measure of **incremental returns ABOVE** the risk-free rate **per unit of risk**.
```

A ratio of **approximately** $0.30$ is a useful rule of thumb for considering the returns potential of a **well-diversified** stock market portfolio.
- Expected return above risk-free rate is $0.30$ times the SD of returns

```ad-important
**Definition 7.2.2**: Market Risk Premium

An estimate of the **expected return** on the market portfolio of all **risky** assets compared to an estimate of the **risk free rate** of interest.
```

We sometimes use a stock market index (e.g. S&P 500) as a proxy for the market portfolio.
- Another estimate of the market risk premium is the **historical equity risk premium**

---

In practice, the **equity risk premium** is typically estimated using a **10-year government bond** as the risk-free proxy.
- Equity risk premium is **NOT constant** over time
- Two historical returns series give different answers and are both relevant
	1. Historical average **difference** between equity market returns and government bond yields or returns
		- $R=\mathbb{E}(R_{m}-R_{b})+R_{b}$
			- Where premium is equal to $\mathbb{E}(R_{m}-R_{b})$
	1. Historical average **real equity market returns**
		- $R=(1+\mathbb{E}(R_{m}))(1+\pi)-1$
			- Where premium is equal to $R-R_b$
