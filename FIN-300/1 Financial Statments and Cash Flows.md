### Road Maps - Two Key Questions
1. Valuation: what are the right investment decisions?
2. Risks, discount rates and market efficiency: what return is **fair** compensation for **risk**?


### Financial Markets
Financial markets are important in that they allocate capitals in an efficient manner.

```ad-important
Financial markets facilitate the interaction between those who need **capital** with those who have **capital** to invest.

FM are **NOT PERFECT**:
- Information problems

#### Main Assets traded in Financial Markets
- **Bond** (Debt)
	- A loan from an investor to a firm. The firm must pay interest and repay the principal at pre-specified date(s) in the future.
		- Cash flows to bondholders have a **time constraint** and default triggers a change in **control rights**.

- **Stocks** (Equity)
	- A security that represents the **ownership** of a fraction of the issuing corporation.
		- Cash flows to shareholders do **NOT** have a time constraint. Dividends and share repurchases are at the **discretion** of the company.

```ad-note
Shareholders are the **last group** to be paid. Shareholders receive money only **after** taxes and interest.
```

- Derivatives
	- Assets whose prices are dependent on other assets.
	- *Out of the scope of this class*

### Decision-Making: Creating shareholder value

Three things that affect the **value** of a business.
1. Cash sooner = higher value
2. More cash = higher value
3. Lower risk = higher value

Our decision rule is to **maximize** the **net present value** of **expected cash flows**.

The content of NPV will be covere shortly in the class.

### Accountings
#### Income Statements
Shows a company's **financial performance** over a **period**.

```ad-note
EBITDA is a measure of **cash flows**! In finance it's more important than profits.
```

#### Balance Sheet
Reports the company's **total asset** and how the assets are financed, either through **debt** or **equity**.

**Assets** are estimates of the physical assets, financial assets, and intangible assets that have been contributed to the business.
- $Total\ Assets = Current\ Assets + Non-current\ Assets$
	- Current: **WITHIN** 12 months
	
- $Assets = Liabilities + Equity$

**Liabilities** are what the business owes to other parties.

**Equity** is how much shareholders have **contributed** (book value), which is not an estimate of what those shares are worth **today** for a sale (market value).

#### Cash Flow Statements
Gives a high-level overview of all **cash movements** over a **period of time**.
- **Investment analysis**: investors care about the timing, magnitude, and risk of prospective cash flows.
- **Risk analysis:** whether a business is likely to become financially distressed depends upon whether it generates **cash** rather than **earnings**.

$Cash\ at\ the\ end = Cash\ at\ the\ beginning + Cash\ movements$
