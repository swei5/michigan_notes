### Valuation Concepts
We will use the free cash flow approach to estimate:
- **Project value**: what is a project worth to a business
- **Enterprise value**: What is an entire enterprise/business/firm worth

To compute what the **equity** is worth in a business, take the **enterprise** **value** and subtract **debt**.

There are two concepts of value:
1. **Market value**: what an asset could sell for in a transaction between a *well-informed* and *willing* buyer and a well-informed and willing seller
2. **Intrinsic value**: what an asset is worth on a **fundamental** basis
	- Reasonable assumptions
