### Returns
#### Period Return

```ad-important
**Definition 7.1.1**: Total Return

Total return is the total **income** earned, i.e., dividends for stocks, coupon for bonds plus **capital gains** (the change in price of the investment), from an investment over a given period.

It is typically expressed as a percentage of the amount that was invested.

$$R_{t, t+1}=\frac{D_{t+1}}{P_{t}}+\frac{P_{t+1}-P_{t}}{P_{t}}$$
```

#### Holding Period Return

```ad-important
**Definition 7.1.2**: Holding Period Return

The holding period return is the return an investor earned **over** a holding period. Expressed as:
1. Total percentage return, or
2. On a periodic basis (annual, quarter)

It can be expressed as
$$1+\text{Holding period return}_{t,t+T}=(1+R_{t,t+1})\cdot \cdots \cdot (1+R_{t+T-1,t+T})$$
```

To transform this to **periodic return**, this is simply
$$R_{n}=(1+R)^{\frac{1}{n}}-1$$
