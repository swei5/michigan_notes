### Returns
#### Period Return

```ad-important
**Definition 7.1.1**: Total Return

Total return is the total **income** earned, i.e., dividends for stocks, coupon for bonds plus **capital gains** (the change in price of the investment), from an investment over a given period.

It is typically expressed as a percentage of the amount that was invested.

$$R_{t, t+1}=\frac{D_{t+1}}{P_{t}}+\frac{P_{t+1}-P_{t}}{P_{t}}$$
```

#### Holding Period Return

```ad-important
**Definition 7.1.2**: Holding Period Return

The holding period return is the return an investor earned **over** a holding period. Expressed as:
1. Total percentage return, or
2. On a periodic basis (annual, quarter)

It can be expressed as
$$1+R_{\text{Holding}, t, t+T}=(1+R_{t,t+1})\cdot \cdots \cdot (1+R_{t+T-1,t+T})$$
```

To transform this to **periodic return**, this is simply
$$R_{n}=(1+R_{\text{Holding}})^{\frac{1}{n}}-1$$

#### Arithmetic Mean Return

```ad-important
**Definition 7.1.3**: Arithmetic Mean Return

A simple average of past returns.
$$\overline{R}_{\text{Arithmetic}}=\frac{\sum_{t}^{T} R_{t,t+1}}{T}$$
```

There are two reasons why this is useful:
1. Provide an **estimate of future returns**, if you want to use the past returns as a sample of data
2. Provide an **unbiased** estimate of **expected future** returns if each return is **INDEPENDENT**

#### Geometric Mean Return

```ad-important
**Definition 7.1.4**: Geometric Mean Return

A way of presenting total returns on a periodic basis. Itâ€™s the same as the total holding period return expressed on a periodic basis.

$$\overline{R}_{\text{Geometric}}=R_{n}=\left(\prod_{t}^{T}(1+R_t)\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}-1$$

where $R_t$ is the holding period return at time $t$.

There are two reasons why this is useful:
1. Reporting **actual performance** to investors
2. More **intuitive** to think of returns on a **periodic basis** than total returns.

The rule of thumb here is that
- Use **arithmetic mean** when making an estimate of future returns based on **sample** of **independent past returns**
	- Have at least some relevance, if not fully appropriate
	- For an individual stock, the past series is **hardly representative** of the future result
- Use **geometric mean** when reporting to investors

### Variance and Uncertainty
Variance and Standard Deviation measure the volatility of asset returns.
- Greater variance $\to$ greater uncertainty

Securities with **more volatile** returns tend to have higher average returns.
- Risk-return tradeoff $\to$ higher risk, higher returns
	- This relationship is **NOT linear**, however

Treasury Bills (short term government bonds) are considered **risk-free**.
- Only free of **default risk**, not [[5.2 Bonds II#^1d83b9|interest rate risk or reinvestment risk]]
	- Free of interest rate risk if the holding period is **locked** in equal to the term to maturity

```ad-important
**Definition 7.1.5**: Risk Premium

Return in excess of the risk-free rate. Also known as **compensation for risk**.
