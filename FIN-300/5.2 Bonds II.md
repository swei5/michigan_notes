### Bond Price Movement
- Bond trading at discount ($P<FV$)
	![[Pasted image 20230227130453.png|400]]
	- The twists and turns are caused by difference in time relative to the coupon payment.
		- As soon as a coupon payment is made at time $t$, the valuation of the bond goes down  immediately after time $t$ as the projected coupon payments decreases - thus the discrete pattern
	- The general upward trend is due to the change in years to maturity, such that the $PV$ of the $FV$ increases exponentially as $t\to T$
		- The increase in $PV_{FV}$ is higher relative to the decrease in $PV_{\mathrm{coupons}}$, which leads to the overall increase in price, since $\mathrm{coupon\ rate}<\mathrm{yield}$

- Bond trading at premium ($P>FV$)
	![[Pasted image 20230227131507.png|400]]
	- The twists and turns are caused by the same reason as above
	- Similar to above, the increase in $PV_{FV}$ is lower relative to the decrease in $PV_{\mathrm{coupons}}$, which leads to the overall increase in price, since $\mathrm{coupon\ rate}>\mathrm{yield}$

### Risks
#### Interest Rate Risk, Reinvestment Risk

**Definition 5.2.1**: Interest Rate Risk, Reinvestment Risk

**Interest Rate Risk**: investors are exposed to the risk that interest rates increase, and so the market value of their bond portfolio falls.

**Reinvestment Risk**: if interest rates fall, investors can now only invest their coupon payments at lower rates than they previously anticipated.
```

```ad-example
![[Pasted image 20230227132508.png|400]]

Investors who bought on the issue date (Aug 13, 2010) and held until Jan 24, 2022 (11.4 years) earned an annual return of 5.4%. But during intermediate periods investors can lose money, or earn returns higher than the yield to maturity.
```

This is because of the **interest rate risk**. 

Investors in the market continuously re-assess
1. How much risk there is
2. What they think is a fair return for risk

This altogether results in what is so-called the **discount rate**.

```ad-important
If interest rates rise:
- Investors lose because the prices of their bonds fall, but
- Investors win because they can invest coupons at higher rates

If interest rates fall
- Investors win because the prices of their bonds rises, but
- Investors lose because they can invest coupons at lower rates
```

Actual bond prices move in a **different direction** to projected, because of **new information** that causes the market to change its **view** on price.

```ad-note
Interest rate risks...
- **DOES NOT** mean that the coupon rate on a bond changes\
	- Coupon payment, face value, term, and thus coupon rate **IS FIXED** as soon as the bond is initialized
- DOES MEAN that the marketâ€™s **required return** (the market interest rate, discount rate, and the opportunity cost) changes from one day to another so bond prices change
	- The price and YTM changes day-to-day
	- Recall the price formulae [[7 Bonds I#^a866bd|here]]
```

The bonds that generate **more** of the present value of cash flows from **payments further in the future** are **MORE exposed** to **interest rate risk**. That is
- Bonds with a lower coupon rate
- Bonds trading at lower yields
- Bonds with a longer term to maturity

Ceteris paribus.

#### Credit Risk
Different bonds have different probabilities of default. Rating agencies estimate:
- Probability of default
	- **Higher** the risk of default, the **lower** the rating
- Recovery in the event of default
	- What proportion of what the bond holders is owed will be repaid
- Assign credit ratings

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires some securities to have a  
**credit rating** issued by a Nationally Recognized Statistical Ratings Organization, NRSRO). There are currently 9 NRSROs.

The rating agencies use a combination of
- Analysis  of accounting information
- Share price and bond price movements

```ad-example
Sample Rating Scale:

![[Pasted image 20230227135659.png|550]]
```

About 80% of ratings can be replicated with a small number of **simple quantitative metrics**, e.g. market value of equity, EBITDA versus interest expense, total debt/EBITDA.

### Yield Curve
Yield curve is a snapshot of yields from bonds of **different maturities**.
- Normally, **upward-sloping**
	- Longer-maturity investors generally demand a premium to compensate the **additional volatility** associated with longer-duration investments
- Can be **downward-sloping**
	- Usually a predictor of economic downturns

There are three drivers of the yield curve
1. Interest rate risk: leads to upward-sloping
2. Expectations of future rate movements: leads to upward-sloping and inverted yield curves
3. Market frictions: lead to upward-sloping and inverted yield curves.

### Important Ratios #Exam

$$\text{Current Yield}=\frac{C}{P}$$

where $C$ is the coupon value in annual terms.
