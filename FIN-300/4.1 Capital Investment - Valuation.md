### Valuation Concepts
We will use the free cash flow approach to estimate:
- **Project value**: what is a project worth to a business
- **Enterprise value**: What is an entire enterprise/business/firm worth

There are two concepts of value:
1. **Market value**: what an asset could sell for in a transaction between a *well-informed* and *willing* buyer and a well-informed and willing seller
2. **Intrinsic value**: what an asset is worth on a **fundamental** basis
	- Reasonable assumptions

We can use **free cash flows** to estimate market value and intrinsic value.

### Free Cash Flow Valuation
1. Compile an income statement, down to the level of earnings before interest and tax (EBIT)
	- $\mathrm{EBIT} = \mathrm{EBITDA} - \mathrm{Depreciation, Amortization}$
2. Estimate free cash flow based upon information from the income statement and other information in nominal dollars
	- Compute earnings before interest and $\mathrm{tax} \cdot (1 - \mathrm{corporate\ tax\ rate})$
		- We need to pay tax on all earnings
	- Reverse any non-cash items that affected earnings (add back non-cash costs and subtract non-cash revenue)
		- Depreciation, Amortization
	- Include any cash flows that do not appear on the income statement
		- Subtract **capital expenditure**
		- Subtract **change in non-debt working capital**
1. Convert the nominal cash flow projections to **present value** using a nominal discount rate
	- There are two periods to consider
		1. The explicit forecast period
		2. The period after the explicit forecast period (extrapolation)

```ad-warning
Explicit **assumptions** about the growth of cash-flows are valid only for the **short run**.
```

From the above steps, we have already known $PV_{0, 1\to i}$ .

Assume the PV of cash flows during explicit forecast period $i$ is $PV_i$. The growth rate of cash flow is $g$ and the discount rate is $r$. Then, we first compute $CF_{i+1}$ by
$$CF_{i+1}=CF(1+g)$$

Then, using perpetuity, the **present value** for cash flows **AT THE END OF PERIOD $i$** **after period** $i$, i.e. $[i+1, \infty)$ is
$$PV_{i, i+1\to \infty}=\frac{CF_{i+1}}{r-g}$$

Finally, we want to obtain the **present value** for cash flows **AT TIME ZERO** for the above (cash flows after period $i$):
$$PV_{0,i\to\infty}=\frac{PV_i}{(1+r)^i}$$

Thus, to get the **present value** for all cash flows at time zero, 
$$PV=PV_{0, 1\to i}+PV_{0,i\to\infty}$$


```ad-note
In some instances there might be **additional** **assets** outside those which generated the free cash flow. If those non-operational assets exist you should also add them in to enterprise value.
```

To compute what the **equity** is worth in a business, take the **enterprise** **value** and subtract **debt**.

### Incremental Cash Flow
The only cash flows that matter for project analysis are cash flows that occur **only if** the project is **undertaken**.

```ad-important
**Definition 4.1.1**: Incremental Cash Flow

Incremental cash flows are changes in cash flows that are a consequence of implementing the project.

Incremental cash flows allow us to value each **project** without having to analyze all other cash flows of the firm.
```

To compute incremental cashflow, we do the following:
1. Compute the valuation of the business with a project
2. Compute the valuation of the business without a project
3. Get the difference

### Cash Flows: Considerations
1. Future cash flows are always estimates
2. Overheads
3. Sunk costs
4. Depreciation
	- Straight-line
	- MACRS (Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System)
		- **More** value deducted in **earlier** years and **less** in **later** years
1. Change in non-debt working capital
2. Capital Investment
