### Stock Basics

```ad-important
**Definition 9.1**: Stocks

Stock is a share of ownership in the firm which entitles the owner to:
- Receive dividends  
- Vote at shareholder meetings    
- Request financial information from the company

**Common vs. preferred stock**
- Common shareholders have **NO** particular entitlement to a dividend
- Preferred shareholders receive a specified **dividend**, unless there isn’t enough cash to repay the lenders
```

How cash is returned to shareholders:
- Dividends - distribution of profits
	- Regular dividend - scheduled dividend paid **every quarter**
	- Special dividend - **one-time** distribution of cash to shareholders
- Share repurchases
	- Buy-backs from investors either on or off the market

Most listed firms pay dividends **and** repurchase shares.
- Stocks that pay dividends are generally perceived as **less risky** than those that don’t.
- 50/50 split between dividend payouts and repurchases in cash return

```ad-important
**Definition 9.2**: Ratios
- The **dividend payout ratio** is the ratio of the total amount of dividends paid out to shareholders relative to the net income of the company.
$$\text{Dividend Payout Ratio}=\frac{D}{NI}$$

- The **total payout ratio** is the pay out on dividends and share repurchases.
$$\text{Total Payout Ratio}=\frac{D+\text{Repurchases}}{NI}$$
```

#### Residual Claim
Equity is a “residual” claim. "Residual" just means the equity holder doesn't get paid **UNTIL** **everybody** else gets paid.
