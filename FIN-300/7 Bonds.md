| Price            | What two well-informed and willing investors are willing to exchange a bond for, typically the **last traded price** (different from Face Value) |     |
| Coupon Payment   | A payment to the bond holder specified in the contract between the issuer and the bond holder.                                                   |     |
| Zero-coupon Bond | A bond with zero coupon payments, AKA **pure discount bond**                                                                                     |     |                                                                                          |     |

```ad-note
Bond prices are often expressed as a **percent price** relative to a base of 100.  

For example, if the face value is $1,000 and the price is $1,050 the bond price could be quoted as 105 (that is, $1,050 ÷ $1,000 × 100 = 105)
```

```ad-important
**Definition 7.2**: Coupon Rate

A way of quoting the coupon payments as a percentage of face value.
- The coupon rate is quoted as an APR.

```

In the previous example, there is a coupon payment of $20 every six months, so $40 per year the coupon rate is $40 of coupon payments ÷ Face value of $1,000 = 4.00%.

The relationship between the **coupon payment** and the **coupon rate** can be expressed in the following equations:
$$\mathrm{Annual\ Coupon\ Payment}=\mathrm{Annual\ Coupon\  Rate}\cdot FV$$
$$\mathrm{Coupon\ Payment\ per\ Period}=\frac{\mathrm{Annual\ Coupon\  Rate}}{n}\cdot FV$$


```ad-important
**Definition 7.3**: Yield-to-Maturity (YTM)

The **rate of return** from holding the bond to maturity, if there is no default and all payments are made as promised.
```

We compute the yield to maturity as an [[4 Investment Decision Rules#^d8138a|Internal Rate of Return]]. “What return would set the present value of the promised cash flows equal to the price? ”

**Current yield** is the return from income on a bond, computed as **annual coupon payments** divided by price.
