### Overview
Earning above-benchmark returns needs
- Forward-looking information
- Friction that impedes other investors from trading off the same information
- Great execution

```ad-important
**Definition 10.1**: Persistence Scorecard (S&P)

The semiannual S&P Persistence Scorecard tracks the degree to which **historical** relative performance is **predictive** of future relative performance.

The S&P persistence scorecard shows transition matrices for equity and bond portfolio managers, showing the proportion of high-performing and low-performing managers in a subsequent period.
```

Here, the transition matrices show that there is **some persistence** in performance, but it is small.
- Top-half managers tend to still perform better than lower-half managers

There is more persistence of performance in **bonds** than in stocks, however.

### Efficient Market

```ad-important
**Definition 10.2**: Efficient Market Hypothesis, Abnormal Returns

The efficient market hypothesis states that it is **impossible** to consistently generate **abnormal returns**, as all relevant information is already reflected in market prices.

An abnormal return is a return **above** what you would expect an investment to earn, given its risk. In simple English, to beat the market.
```

In other words, an efficient market is one in which you **CANNOT** **persistently** implement a strategy to generate positive abnormal returns.

In real life, market has a degree of inefficiency to it. There is a **spectrum of inefficiency**.

```ad-note
Some simple and common market strategies that prove to be usually profitable:
- Buying stocks with large positive earnings surprise
- 
```

#### Weak Form Efficient Market

```ad-important
**Definition 10.3**: Weak Form Efficient Market

In a weak-form efficient market, **all past market prices** and price movements are fully **reflected** in the current market price of a security.
```

You **CANNOT** earn abnormal returns by analyzing **historical price** and **volume** information.

#### Semi-Strong Form Efficient Market

```ad-important
**Definition 10.4**: Semi-Strong Form Efficient Market

In a semi-strong form efficient market, **all publicly available information** is reflected in the current market price of a security.
- Past data
- Public information, such as news, financial statements, reports
```

**Fundamental analysis**, which is the study of a company's financial and economic data to determine its intrinsic value, **CANNOT** be used to consistently generate abnormal returns.

#### Strong Form Efficient Market

```ad-important
**Definition 10.5**: Strong Form Efficient Market

In a strong-form efficient market, **all information**, both public and private, is reflected in the current market price of a security.
```

In reality, **NO** market is strong form efficient since there is always **inside information**.

There is a degree of **inefficiency** in the markets which can be **exploited** using publicly-available information, but it is not easy.
- Market is at least weak form but not strong form efficient

### Price Bubbles, Irrational Behaviors
There are three characteristics of an asset price bubble.
1. A substantial **increase** in the **volume** of trade.
2. Composition of the investor base switches from **institutional to retail**
3. Trades made **WITHOUT** any consideration of fundamentals
	- Traders don’t seem to care that earnings, cash flows, and discount rates matter at all
	- Extreme reference bias and extrapolations

```ad-important
**Definition 10.6**: Reference Bias

The belief that the price a purchaser paid for a security has some **economic meaning** in relation to its future price movements.
- E.g. "I’m waiting to sell at the price I paid so I get my money back"
```

Another reason of market inefficiency may be attributed to **irrational behavior** exhibited by humans trading in the markets.
- Over-confidence
	- More frequent retail traders tend to earn lower returns than less frequent traders because of higher transaction costs
- Regret
	- Reference bias
- Familiarity
	- Personal preferences and connection with certain assets
- Overweighting recent information
	- More weights are placed on investor's personal experience and observation

```ad-summary
- We will have an **efficient** market if there are enough **rational traders** who can exploit behavioral biases, thereby **pushing prices** to efficient levels, provided they have capacity to trade without constraints on capital, liquidity and regulation.
- We will have an **inefficient** market if rational traders have **limited ability** to exploit individuals’ behavioral biases

**Exploitable inefficiencies** are present where there are **constraints** to arbitrage based upon:
- Costly information
- Incomplete markets for trades
- Lack of unlimited access to capital
```
