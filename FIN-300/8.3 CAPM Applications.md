### Beta
Let's first recap what $\beta$ entails in the CAPM model: ![[8.2 CAPM#^b3afc2]]
Note that, the **expected return** of security $i$, is sometimes also known as the **cost of equity**.

In essence,
- $\beta = 1$: average level of systematic risk
- $\beta > 1$: high level of systematic risk
- $\beta < 1$: low level of systematic risk

For instance, a company that largely depends on sales and earnings would have a higher beta value as its performance is closely related to the **overall economic activity**.

The beta of a portfolio of assets is a market value weighted average of the beta of each asset in the portfolio. $$\beta_{p}=\sum\limits_{i}w_{i}\beta_{i}$$
```ad-important
**Definition 8.3.1**: Systematic risk portion of total portfolio risk

Mathematically, this is $$\frac{\text{Sys Risk}}{\text{Portfolio Risk}}=\frac{\beta_{p}^{2}\text{Var}(R_{M})}{\text{Var}(R_{p})}$$
```

```ad-note
- Beta is forward-looking. It is an **expected value**
- We cannot observe the **true** beta for any asset.
- We want to use all available returns data to estimate beta
```
