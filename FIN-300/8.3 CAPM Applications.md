### Beta
Let's first recap what $\beta$ entails in the CAPM model: ![[8.2 CAPM#^b3afc2]]
Note that, the **expected return** of security $i$, is sometimes also known as the **cost of equity**.

In essence,
- $\beta = 1$: average level of systematic risk
- $\beta > 1$: high level of systematic risk
- $\beta < 1$: low level of systematic risk

For instance, a company that largely depends on sales and earnings would have a higher beta value as its performance is closely related to the **overall economic activity**.

The beta of a portfolio of assets is a market value weighted average of the beta of each asset in the portfolio. $$\beta_{p}=\sum\limits_{i}w_{i}\beta_{i}$$
```ad-important
**Definition 8.3.1**: Systematic risk portion of total portfolio risk

Mathematically, this is $$\frac{\text{Sys Risk}}{\text{Portfolio Risk}}=\frac{\beta_{p}^{2}\text{Var}(R_{M})}{\text{Var}(R_{p})}$$
```

```ad-note
- Beta is forward-looking. It is an **expected value**
- We cannot observe the **true** beta for any asset.
- We want to use all available returns data to estimate beta
```

#### Application: Beta
1. Make a beta estimate based on
	- Scatter plot ($X$ as market returns, $Y$ as stock returns)
		- In Excel, `=SLOPE(Y:array, X:array) -> float`
		- Or, `=COVARIANCES.S(Y:array, X:array)/VAR.S(X:array) -> float`
2. Compute the systematic risk component of the stock’s returns using [[8.3 CAPM Applications#^e84c4c|this formula]]
	- This the same as computing **R-Squared**
		- In Excel, `=RSQ(Y:array, X:array) -> float`
	- The results we get from this is **exposure to overall market risk**, and the remaining is strictly **subject to industry/firm**

#### Application: Risk-free Rate
Common proxy is the **YTM** on **10-year** government bonds.
- Longer YTM (20-30 years) can be used, provided the bonds are **liquid** and the measurement of risk-free rate is consistent with the measurement of the **market risk premium**

1. Find the data of 10-year treasury yield on [Fed's website](-   https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/ ) , expressed as an APR
2. Calculate the [[2.1 Discounted Cash Flow I#^4bebb9|effective annual rate]] for the rate

#### Application: Market Risk Premium
The market risk premium is **forward-looking**. We want to look for the following indicators
- Earnings yield (EPS projection/P) minus risk-free rate
- Implied volatility from options prices
- Term spread (long-term bond yields vs short-term bond yields)
- Corporate bond spreads (corporate bonds vs government bonds)

```ad-tldr
It is possible to estimate the expected market return. However, in this course we will only consider **historical data** as a proxy. These includes
- Average market returns less government bond yields
- Average real market returns, converted to expected **nominal** returns minus today’s risk-free rate
```

##### Method 1: Top-Down
1. Find the data of 10-year treasury yield on [Fed's website](-   https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/ ) , expressed as an APR, then convert to **effective annual rate**
2. Get the **projected market risk premium** by taking an average of market returns less government bond yields
3. Get **nominal projected market return** by adding (1) and (2)
4. Get **inflation** data by subtracting 10-year inflation indexed bonds from 10-year nominal treasury yields, citing data from [here](-   https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/ )
5. Convert **nominal projected market return** to **real rate** using the Fisher Equation: ![[4.2 Capital Investment - Interest Rate#^2fe11c]]

##### Method 2: Bottom-Up
1. Compute **inflation** for each year from **YoY CPI Change**
2. Compute **real market return** for each year citing the Fisher Equation, then get the **projected real market return** by taking the average of the series
3. Get **nominal projected return** again by using the Fisher Equation
4. Make an estimate of the **market risk premium** by subtracting **risk-free rate** today from **nominal projected return**

```ad-note
The answers from method 1 and method 2 are different, because
- The assumption underpinning approach 1 is that the **premium** the market requires for risk is the **SAME** that we have observed on average in the past, regardless of whether government bond yields are high or low.
- The assumption underpinning approach 2 is that the **real return** the market requires for investing in the market is the **SAME** as we have observed on average in the past, regardless of whether government bond yields are high or low.

Surprisingly, neither assumption is entirely true or false. And, again, it's wise to do both methods and take an average from the results to minimize estimation errors.
```

### CAPM, Limitation
Potential Risks using CAPM include
- **Equity Risk Premium** (ERP) is not stable over time
- Challenges in labeling a risk as *systematic* or *unsystematic*
- **Beta** too changes over time
- **Proxies** are hard to find since they rarely undertake only one business activity

Potential limitations are
- Biased
	- **Low beta** stocks earn **HIGHER** returns than predicted by the model, and vice versa
- Imprecise
	- Beta estimates vary markedly over time and across similar firms
	- Wide estimation error
- Incomplete
	- Risks are ignored by the model:
		- Liquidity
		- Lack of information
		- Financial distress
		- Inability to disinvest in a downturn
