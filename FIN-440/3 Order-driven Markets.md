**Orders are the fundamental building blocks** of trading strategies. Markets may be classified based on the execution system that implements orders.

An **execution system** is a set of procedures for matching buyers and sellers. In **pure order-driven markets**, execution system is only dependent on orders. Examples include 
- Tokyo Stock Exchange 
- Toronto Stock Exchange 
- Euronext Paris  
- Most futures markets
- NYSE (partially, with the exception of approved dealers)

### Order-driven Markets 
- **Continuous markets**
	- Traders may trade at **ANYTIME** while the market is open
	- Traders may continuously attempt to arrange their trades
	- NYSE from 9:30-4
- **Call markets**
	- Traders may trade in call markets only when the **market is called**
		- You may have all securities called at the same time or only some; the market may be called several times per day
	- The opening price and closing price at NYSE is an example of this market
	- Two types of order:
		- Market on Open (MOO)
		- Limit on Open (LOO)

In order-driven markets, trading rules specify how trades are arranged.
- The **Order Precedence Rules** state as to how buy and sell orders should be arranged and **matched**
- The **Trade Pricing Rules** are used to determine the **price** at which a trade is to be executed

These rules vary across markets.

#### Order Precedence Rules 
**Market orders** have the **highest** priority. Then, the execution price for such orders is determined as follows:
- A market buy/sell order will be executed at the best available price from the **standpoint of the trader**
