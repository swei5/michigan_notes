### Big Picture 
At the end of the term, we will be able to answer questions like:
- What are optimal trading strategies for typical trading problems?
- What are the trading mechanisms in the equity market in the United States?
- Exactly how is information impounded in the price? How do we avoid market failures?
- What can market/trading data tell you about the informational environment of the firm?
- What concerns you may have if you are trading in a dark pool?

### Trading Space 
The two sides of the trading industry: buy side and sell side.
- People and institutions who **use financial services** are on the buy-side.
	- Investing institutions 
	- Money managers
	- Trusts, charity
- Those who **provide financial services** are on the sell-side.'
	- **Dealers**: Securities dealers include individuals or firms that specialize in security market transactions by
		1. Assisting firms in issuing new securities through the underwriting and market placement of new security issues,
		2. And trading in new or outstanding securities on their own account, i.e., the dealer stands ready and willing to buy a security for its own account (at its bid price) or sell from its own account (at its ask price)
		- NASDAQ 
	- **Brokers**: trading for other peopleâ€™s accounts, acting as an intermediary between an investor and the financial market
		- NYSE
	- **Broker-dealers** do both
		- Fidelity, Vanguard, Goldman.

**Consultants** provide information to sell and buy sides.

```ad-note
Because securities exchanges only accept orders from individuals or firms who are **members of that exchange**, individual traders and investors need the services of exchange members. Brokers provide that service and are compensated in various ways.

A dealer is different from a trader. While a dealer buys and sells securities as **part of its regular business**, a trader buys and sells securities **for his or her own account** and not on a business basis.

#### Trade Facilitators

	- NSCC provides clearing, settlement, risk management, central counterparty services and a guarantee of completion for certain transactions for virtually all broker-to-broker trades
- **Depositories** and custodians hold securities

### Instruments 
Financial securities represent ownership of real assets and the cash flows that they generate. 
- Stocks mostl

Derivative instruments derive their values from the values of the underlying instruments upon which they are based.
- Derivatives are usually **zero-sum instruments** that sellers create.
