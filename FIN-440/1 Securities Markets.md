### Big Picture 
At the end of the term, we will be able to answer questions like:
- What are optimal trading strategies for typical trading problems?
- What are the trading mechanisms in the equity market in the United States?
- Exactly how is information impounded in the price? How do we avoid market failures?
- What can market/trading data tell you about the informational environment of the firm?
- What concerns you may have if you are trading in a dark pool?

### Trading Space 
The two sides of the trading industry: buy side and sell side.
- People and institutions who **use financial services** are on the buy-side.
	- Investing institutions 
	- Money managers
	- Trusts, charity
- Those who **provide financial services** are on the sell-side.'
	- **Dealers**: Securities dealers include individuals or firms that specialize in security market transactions by
		1. Assisting firms in issuing new securities through the underwriting and market placement of new security issues,
		2. And trading in new or outstanding securities on their own account, i.e., the dealer stands ready and willing to buy a security for its own account (at its bid price) or sell from its own account (at its ask price)
		- NASDAQ 
	- **Brokers**: trading for other people’s accounts, acting as an intermediary between an investor and the financial market
		- NYSE
	- **Broker-dealers** do both
		- Fidelity, Vanguard, Goldman.

**Consultants** provide information to sell and buy sides.

```ad-note
Because securities exchanges only accept orders from individuals or firms who are **members of that exchange**, individual traders and investors need the services of exchange members. Brokers provide that service and are compensated in various ways.

A dealer is different from a trader. While a dealer buys and sells securities as **part of its regular business**, a trader buys and sells securities **for his or her own account** and not on a business basis.

#### Trade Facilitators
- **Exchanges** provide systems that help traders arrange their trades 
	- Importance of exchanges has **declined** in recent decades
- **Clearing houses** facilitate the exchange (i.e., clearance) of payments, securities, or derivatives transactions
	- Main one is National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC)
	- NSCC provides clearing, settlement, risk management, central counterparty services and a guarantee of completion for certain transactions for virtually all broker-to-broker trades
- **Depositories** and custodians hold securities
	- Main one is Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC)

### Instruments 
Financial securities represent ownership of real assets and the cash flows that they generate. 
- Stocks mostly trade on **exchanges**
- Bonds mostly trade on the **OTC (over-the-counter) market**

Derivative instruments derive their values from the values of the underlying instruments upon which they are based. These include 
- **Options**: contracts giving holders rights that they do not have to exercise
- **Forward contracts**: contracts to trade at a set price in the future and they are **traded on OTC markets**
- **Futures**: forward contracts **traded on an exchange**
- **Swaps**: contracts to exchange cash flows

Swaps make up the largest segment in the derivative market.

```ad-note
Derivatives are usually **zero-sum instruments** that sellers create.

### Trading Markets 
Various securities are traded on various markets. These markets generally have vastly different organizations and mechanisms, e.g., trading rules, pricing rules, etc.
- **Dealers Market** (OTC)
	- Operates with a dealer that acts as a **counterparty for both buyers and sellers** of a security
	- Dealer sets bid and ask prices for the security in question
	- Less common in stocks, but **more common in bonds**, **derivative** securities and **currencies**
- **Brokers Market** (Exchanges)
	- Operates by **finding a counterparty** to both buyers and sellers
	- Appropriate for tailored or custom products

Dealers may also participate in the market.

**Exchanges** are mainly **automated brokered markets**. Trades are executed based on **order books** that match buyers with sellers.
- Automated, requiring **NO dealer intermediary**
- Most appropriate for **standardized** securities
- **Provision of a central location** (physical of computer network) for buyers and sellers to find their counterparties

```ad-summary
**Consolidate vs. Fragmented Markets**

- **Consolidated**: all trading happens in one place. 
	- One “trading floor” or one computer system
- **Fragmented**: trading is dispersed
	- Multiple trading locations or computer systems
	- Most stocks markets

The “home” for trading a stock is the stock’s **primary listing exchange**. The primary listing exchange
- Provides trading facilities/procedures
- May arrange for a dealer to assist trading 
- Coordinates openings and trading halts, however
- **DOES NOT** have a monopoly on trading
	- $BAC is listed on NYSE and it is traded on both NYSE (a broker market) and Nasdaq (a dealer market)
