### Brokers 
A broker is an agent working on behalf of a buyer or a seller.
- **Retail brokers** service individuals 
	- **Discount brokers** (Scott Trade, Interactive Brokers) provide **services related to trading**
	- **Full service brokers** (Charles Schwab, Merrill Lynch) also provide **research and advice**
- **Prime brokers** service institutions such as mutual funds and hedge funds
	- Larger trades, more securities, more markets
	- Specialized services (for margin trading and short selling)
#### Brokerage Functions
- Brokers are negotiators
- Trustworthy and creditworthy
- Brokers know their clients 
- Brokers are clearing and settlement agents 

#### Brokerage Commissions 
Brokers have traditionally charged customers commissions on each trade. "Zero commissions" **DOES NOT** mean zero costs. Customers pay for trading services in many ways.
- Commission-free trades go to off-exchange brokers, meaning that the exchange will not have access to the trade information, and thus **increasing the bid-ask spread and thus transaction cost**

**Soft dollars** are a way for mutual funds to get services without having to pay for them directly.
- Common in the institutional brokerage market
- Expenses are hidden in the trading costs
- Often abused

A fund’s trading activity, the buying, and selling of portfolio securities is not included in the calculation of the expense ratio.

A **hard dollar** payment would require a **check to be issued and recorded on a fund’s books**, and the corresponding cash expense to be passed onto investors via the fund’s annual fee.

#### Principal-Agent Problem 
Stock brokers earn a living through commissions; therefore, there is a **risk for conflict between a stock broker’s interest and the interests of his clients**.
- Broker may assign the worst priced trade to the client and keeps the best priced trade for himself or for a favored client

Illegal brokerage activities include
- **Trade Assignment**
	- The broker **assigns the worst priced trade** to the client and keeps the best priced trade for himself or for a favored client
- **Front-running**
	- Client's trade has market impact
		- E.g. Broker executes their own order before placing client's
	- Front-running based on proprietary brokerage information is illegal 
	- Front-running by **observant traders is legal**
- **Churning**
	- When a broker engages in **excessive buying and selling** of securities in a customer’s account without considering the customer’s investment goals to generate commissions
- **Kickbacks**
	- An illegal payment intended as compensation for preferential treatment or any other type of improper services received

#### Order Flows 
Payment for order flow refers to the compensation that a broker receives, not from its clients, but from a third party that **wants to influence how the broker routes client orders for fulfillment**.
- Many retail stock brokers commonly route their order flow to dealers who pay them for each market order sent.
- E.g. Robinhood
