### Logic

- Finish the next sequence
	- Figures or shapes
	- Numerical
	- Patterns (example)
		![[Pasted image 20230115221449.png]]

- Finding commonalities of items
	- Shapes (example)
	- Patterns
	- Values
	- Vocabularies (synonyms and antonym)
		- e.g. Water is to cup as flowers are to $\set{garden, roses, petals, vase}$

- Assumptions and Inferences
	- If/Else

	- General

### Quantitative-Analysis

- Graph Comprehension
	- e.g., Company A made $x$ in sales in a year from products $a,b,c,d$. Given some evidence, find the proportion of revenue each product contributes to the total sales and present it using a pie chart.
- Data Analysis
	- e.g. Given some statistics (sales, number of users, etc.) of year 1 and 2 for products $p$ and the growth of products from year 1 to year 2, calculate
		- Statistics for product $p_i$ in year $i$, including its proportion in total sales
- Easy pre-calc math
	- e.g. *You have invited 94 people to a meeting. Of those people, 11 from the North cannot attend, 7 from the South cannot attend, 3 from the East cannot attend, and 11 from the West cannot attend. How many people should you expect to attend the meeting?*

### Business-Intelligence
- Arrange meeting times, given the availability of conference rooms/personnels.
- Tricky sorting problem

```ad-example
**Example 1**: Arrange training session for 5 employees throughout the month. Training takes 3 days in a row and can only happen during weekdays. Bob cannot attend training in the last week of the month. Rebecca has to be between Kay and John. Richards can't train on Wednesdays, etc.
```

```ad-example
**Example 2**: Sort 5 employees in order of their proficiency with Excel. Bob is at least better than 2 other employees but worse than 1. John cannot be the last. Jessica is between Dora and Ben. Etc.
```

### General-Administrative
- Handling conflicts
- Reporting tasks
- Individual vs Team
- Conventional vs Inventive
- Handling relationships with peers/managers
