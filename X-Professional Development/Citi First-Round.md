### Why Citi
#### Global bank
Firstly, Citi is a global bank with a great international presence and resources. With my international background and experience, I believe that working for Citi will give me a unique perspective on global business and help me develop a broader understanding of the world's financial landscape. 

It will also provide me with opportunities to collaborate with colleagues from different backgrounds and learn from their experiences, and I can contribute to the firm's global mission using my global perspectives and experiences in return.

#### Working environment
I am also excited about the opportunity to interact with different desks and teams as part of the rotational program. I believe that this program will help me learn more about different products and roles, and engage with different clients at Citi. 

I also appreciate the level of flexibility and early responsibility given for the interns. In my conversation with Max Cober, who worked as an S&T summer analyst at Citi last year, I learned that he was able to rotate through three different desks across different sales and trading functions, and he was given an actual task to execute a trade order on his first day, so that was super cool, getting lots of hands-on experience and exposure to the market early on and trying out different types of tasks and working in different desks. 

#### Culture
Lastly and obviously, Citi's culture is one of the reasons why I am eager to join the team. The level of support that every team receives from each other within Markets. During my coffee chat with Paul and Vinita back in February, they all touched on that Citi is such a big firm and they were able to find all kinds of resources and support on the same floor. 

I think in our conversation you've also mentioned that there is a research team dedicated to providing most-recent market insights and developing algorithms that serve to support sales and trading tasks. So that's amazing - the level of support you have is immaculate. 

And from all people I've conversed with at Citi they've all told me that never to ask dumb questions. I feel like that is a really important aspect showing how Citi has such an amazing culture and is always committed to helping its workers to grow and develop.

### Why S&T
#### Anecdote
The market has always been exciting for me since I was young age.  As a soccer fan, I remember when Cristiano Ronaldo's act of removing a Coke bottle during a press conference caused a significant drop in the company's stock. It was an eye-opening experience that highlighted how seemingly small actions can have major financial implications. 

It taught me that financial markets are interconnected with so many realms and disciplines, making them relevant to our daily lives. It's fascinating to think about the ripple effects of decisions made by traders and analysts, and I want to be a part of it. 

#### Quantitative Skills
In addition, I see sales and trading as a field where I get to leverage my data skills to make informed decisions and drive outcomes as I am a highly quantitative person. 
- Gigantic, dynamic Dathaon
- Constantly changing and unpredictable
- Client-facing too, not all about data

The market provides immediate feedback on the effectiveness of my actions, which is incredibly rewarding and allows me to see the impact of my work in real time. 

I am excited about the prospect of being part of a team that is constantly seeking out new opportunities and making empirical positive changes in this dynamic and challenging field. In my classes, most of the tasks are really theoretical based - cat vs dog classifier for instance, I want something more hands on and the opportunity to work for Markets has always sounded fascinating.

#### Passion
And just from my previous conversations with people working at Citi, especially the traders, Patrick Keenan (Michigan alum) who works in CMBS trading, said his day starts really early, at 6:30 or 7 potentially and ends really late like around 7 or 8. 

So it speaks to me that it's also a job that demands long working hours, constant focus and commitment. However, everyone I've spoken to, not only Patrick, seem so passionate and excited about it. That speaks to me that this has to be a really fun job. Ultimately, I want to be part of a team that is both challenging and fun, and I believe that sales and trading at Citi provides such an opportunity.

### Market View
#### Continuous Hikes of the Interest Rate
Well, yesterday, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by another 25 basis points, which marked its, I think, eighth or ninth straight rate increase. It's at 5 percent now and it was only 0.5 percent at this time last year. 

However, what's interesting is that the Fed also hinted that it may wrap up the rate hikes soon due to troubles in the banking sector. Serious difficulties at a small number of banks, namely the smaller-scale regional banks have emerged, namely the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and its ripple effects across the sector.
- Hard-landing for lots of businesses and consumers

Although it may sound bizarre, the banking turmoil could have actually helped the Fed's efforts to curb borrowing and slow down the economy to combat inflation. As banks hunker down during the storm, it's "likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses and to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. I think our inflation data is still high at 6%, this could help lower price growth, and we've also seen improvement since January so this could be a silver-lining.

#### Inflation
Obviously another big thing to watch for is inflation. In recent months, inflation has slowed but remains high. Consumer prices, for instance, are still roughly 6 percent higher than they were at this point last year, and many experts had urged the Fed to hold off on another increase until the dust had settled on the instability in the banking sector.

The regional banking crisis definitely warns the Fed about the potential hazard of continuing rising interest rate to combat inflation. So instead of the original target of a half percent increase, it is only one quarter. It is possible that the Fed can pause raising rates at this point, but the data on inflation (6% core CPI in feb 2023) is still higher than expected and the labor market is tighter than ever.

There’s a high degree of uncertainty now with respect to how the Fed will deal with inflation. We will have to speculate at this point I guess.
- Too high - fragile economy breaks into a recession
- Too low - inflation continues to haunt us

#### Reopening of China
Through fits and starts, China's relaxation of COVID restrictions may prompt a rebound in services activities and lead to a cyclical economic uptick. Not only it is a good signal for the country's economic recovery but also provides huge boost to our global economy. As Chinese consumers return to the mall and workspaces, we will anticipate a huge increase in domestic demand. This is welcome news for China’s regional neighbors, as Asia-Pacific economies export lots of goods to China.

It also stimulates international and business travels. A normalized travel pattern will ease supply chain frictions we've been witnessing for the past two years, and potentially leading to lower transportation costs and thus an increase in import/export volumes in China and a boost in foreign and Chinese GDP.

Other factors to consider: commodity market - oil demand.

Due to the faster-than-expected rate of reopening, our economists now forecast China’s GDP to grow by 6.5% in 2023

Over all, my expectation for the prospect of the market this year is mixed may be somewhat positive, with a potential upside of 3-5% for the S&P index.
- Much of growth is suppressed by the interest rate hike
- Interesting story I heard from podcast yesterday talking about Fed injecting a huge amount of cash to secure deposits in SVB, Signature and First Republic Bank. This is **quant easing**, reduces the risk of recession while not necessarily injecting more free cash into the Reopening of China
- Broad-based declines in asset prices in 2022 imply much cheaper valuations to start the year in 2023, with long-term valuations of bonds and non-US equities relatively attractive.
