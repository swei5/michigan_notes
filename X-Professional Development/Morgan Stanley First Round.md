**Sales and trading** is one of the primary front-office divisions of major [investment banks]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_banking "Investment banking"). The term is typically reserved for the trading activities done by **sell-side investment banks** who are primarily engaged in **making markets** for institutional clients in various forms of securities. [[1]] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_and_trading#cite_note-1 ) The trading floor of these banks will contain [dedicated desks]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_desk "Trading desk") who generally focus exclusively on trading one form of security. These desks will more generally fall within the categories of fixed income, currencies, commodities, or equities.

In [market making]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_maker "Market maker"), traders will **buy and sell financial products** primarily to facilitate the **investment and trading activities of its clients** with the goal of making an incremental amount of money on each trade.

The term market maker refers to a firm or individual who actively quotes [two-sided markets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/two-sidedmarket.asp) in a particular security by providing [bids](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid.asp) and offers (known as [asks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/ask.asp)) along with the market size of each. Market makers provide [liquidity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp) and depth to markets and profit from the difference in the [bid-ask spread](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-askspread.asp).

### Why MS
#### Global bank
Firstly, Morgan Stanley is a global bank with a great international presence and resources. With my international background and experience, I believe that working for Morgan Stanley will give me a unique perspective on global business and help me develop a broader understanding of the world's financial landscape. 

It will also provide me with opportunities to collaborate with colleagues and engaging with our clients from different backgrounds and learn from their experiences, and I can contribute to the firm's global mission using my perspectives and experiences in return.

#### Working environment
I am also excited about the opportunity to interact with different desks and teams as part of the rotational program. I believe that this program will help me learn more about different products and roles, and engage with different clients at Morgan Stanley. 

I also appreciate the level of flexibility and early responsibility given for the interns. In my conversation with Nakul who is also on the Michigan team, I learned that he was able to work with a lot of desks and people on the trading floor, which is super cool as you get to know more about all kinds of asset classes and the market as a whole. He described to me the internship program as a paid opportunity to learn - which I really appreciate as I love learning especially about the financial markets, and I being surrounded by some of the smartest people in the world. I am also aware this is a role that's really hands on and requires responsibility early on. I love it because I want to gain that exposure to the market and get my hands dirty.

#### Culture
Lastly and obviously, Morgan Stanley's culture is one of the reasons why I am eager to join the team. The level of support that every team receives from each other within Markets. During my coffee chat with Liv back in February, they all touched on that Morgan Stanley is such a big firm and they were able to find all kinds of resources and support on the same floor.  Nakul also brought to me that there is a research team dedicated to providing most-recent market insights and developing strategies that serve to support sales and trading tasks. So that's fascinating - the level of support you have is immaculate. 

And from all people I've conversed with at Morgan Stanley they've all told me that never to ask dumb questions. I feel like that is a really important aspect showing how Morgan Stanley has such an amazing culture and is always committed to helping its workers to grow and develop.

### Why S&T
#### Anecdote
The market has always been exciting for me since I was young age.  As a soccer fan, I remember when Cristiano Ronaldo's act of removing a Coke bottle during a press conference caused a significant drop in the company's stock. It was an eye-opening experience that highlighted how seemingly small actions can have major financial implications. 

It taught me that financial markets are interconnected with so many realms and disciplines, making them relevant to our daily lives. It's fascinating to think about the ripple effects of decisions made by traders and analysts, and I want to be a part of it. 

#### Quantitative Skills
In addition, I see sales and trading as a field where I get to leverage my data skills to make informed decisions and drive outcomes as I am a highly quantitative person. 
- Gigantic, dynamic Dataathon
- Constantly changing and unpredictable
- Client-facing too, not all about data

The market provides immediate feedback on the effectiveness of my actions, which is incredibly rewarding and allows me to see the impact of my work in real time. 

I am excited about the prospect of being part of a team that is constantly seeking out new opportunities and making empirical positive changes in this dynamic and challenging field. In my classes, most of the tasks are really theoretical based - cat vs dog classifier for instance, I want something more hands on and the opportunity to work for Markets has always sounded fascinating.

#### Passion
And just from my previous conversations with people working at Morgan Stanley, especially the traders, they said their day would start really early, at 6:30 or 7 potentially and ends really late like around 7 or 8 pm. 

So it appears to me that it's also a job that demands long working hours, constant focus and commitment. However, everyone I've spoken to seem so passionate and excited about it. That speaks to me that this has to be a really fun job. And I think I am a fast-paced person too, I love to work with hectic things that constantly demand an action. So I think market is a great fit for my personality too.

Ultimately, I want to be part of a team that is both challenging and fun, and I believe that sales and trading at Morgan Stanley provides such an opportunity.

### Random Behavorial

### Market View
#### Continuous Hikes of the Interest Rate

It's already at 5 percent now and it was only 0.5 percent at this time last year. I think this is the fastest or steepest increase ever, unprecedented even during the 2008 financial crisis.

March employment data are still strong. With further rises in energy prices led by oil possible, rate hikes are still on the table.
- 70% rates of another round of interest rate hike next month by another 25 basis points

Although it may sound bizarre, the banking turmoil could have actually helped the Fed's efforts to curb borrowing and slow down the economy to combat inflation. Due to the failures in the banking sector, it's likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses and to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. 

Interesting story I heard from podcast yesterday talking about Fed injecting a huge amount of liquidity to secure deposits in SVB, Signature and First Republic Bank. This is **quant easing**, reduces the risk of recession while not necessarily injecting more free cash into the economy

The banking crisis definitely warns the Fed about the potential hazard of continuing rising interest rate to combat inflation. I think our inflation data is still high at 6%, this could help lower price growth, and we've also seen improvement since January so this could be a silver-lining.

#### Inflation
Obviously another big thing to watch for is inflation data. In recent months, inflation has slowed but remains high. Consumer prices, for instance, are still roughly 6 percent higher than they were at this point last year, and many experts had urged the Fed to hold off on another increase until the dust had settled on the instability in the banking sector.

There’s a high degree of uncertainty now with respect to how the Fed will deal with inflation. We will have to speculate at this point I guess.
- Too high - fragile economy breaks into a recession
	- SVB, First Republic, Signature are examples of how tightening credits and steep increase in short term interest rate could affect the market
- Too low - inflation continues to haunt us

In addition, the global consumer-spending outlook remains uncertain, as consumer spending is still heavily skewed towards goods. As demand normalizes back toward services, demand for goods could weaken just as supply-chain bottlenecks are clearing and inventories are rebuilt. This could threaten the profitability of goods-producing companies. The uncertain consumer attitude toward income prospects and weakening international demand due to geopolitical instabilities add to the muddy outlook.

At this point it's really all about consumer expectations and business confidence, as the hope of getting a soft landing has basically vanish.

A lot of this is contingent upon the March CPI data tomorrow



#### Reopening of China
China's relaxation of COVID restrictions may also prompt a rebound in services activities and lead to a cyclical economic uptick. Not only it is a good signal for the country's economic recovery but also provides huge boost to our global economy. As Chinese consumers return to the mall and workspaces, we will anticipate a huge increase in domestic demand. This is welcome news for China’s regional neighbors, as Asia-Pacific economies export lots of goods to China.

It also stimulates international and business travels. A normalized travel pattern will ease supply chain frictions we've been witnessing for the past two years, and potentially leading to lower transportation costs and thus an increase in import/export volumes in China and a boost in foreign and Chinese GDP.

Due to the faster-than-expected rate of reopening, economists now forecast China’s GDP to grow by 6.5% in 2023

Over all, my expectation for the prospect of the market this year is mixed may be somewhat positive, with a potential upside of ~5% for the S&P index.
- Fair, since it's up by 7% YTD already
- Much of growth is led by rebound from last year, but will be suppressed by the interest rate hike
- Broad-based declines in asset prices in 2022 imply much cheaper valuations to start the year in 2023, with long-term valuations of bonds and non-US equities relatively attractive.

### Stock Pitch (Sector Pitch)
#### Long
Invest in gold or precious metal.
- Safe assets during turmoiled time
- Hedge against recession as well as inflation
- As an alternative investment, diversify one's portfolio

Tesla ticker (TSLA) on the NASDAQ currently trading around $187. Anticipate a 10% upside by the end of the year from now, considering it's already up by ~70% YTD.

1.  Dominant Position in EV Market: Tesla is the leader in the electric vehicle market with 23% global market share. The company has a significant first-mover advantage in the industry, and its focus on sustainability has made it a favorite among investors and consumers alike. Its recent price cuts on its models also help consolidate their positioning in the market.
    
2.  Strong Growth Prospects: Tesla's growth prospects remain strong as the company expands its production capacity and enters new markets. Its revenue grew by almost 70% YoY in 2021. The company's recent investments in battery production facilities will further strengthen its position in the market and help reduce the impact of the current supply chain constraints. Recent factories opening in Texas, Mexico and China are signaling the investors that the tech giant is intending to strengthen its global presence amid uncertainties and high inflation.
    
3.  Attractive Valuation: Despite its rapid growth and dominant position in the industry, Tesla's current valuation remains attractive compared to its peers. The company's forward P/E ratio (68.2) is lower than the industry average (88.5), and its revenue growth is expected to remain robust over the next few years. 
    

Risks and Mitigants:
1.  Supply Chain Constraints: The current shortage of battery materials could impact Tesla's production capacity and revenue growth in the short term. However, the company is taking proactive steps to mitigate the impact of the shortage by investing in its own production facilities and seeking out new suppliers.
    
2.  Competition: Tesla faces significant competition in the electric vehicle market from established automakers such as Ford, General Motors, and Volkswagen. However, Tesla's brand and technology are strong differentiators, and the company's focus on innovation and sustainability should help it maintain its leadership position in the industry.
    
3.  Regulatory Risks: The electric vehicle industry is subject to regulatory risks, including changes in government incentives and regulations. However, Tesla has a track record of successfully navigating regulatory hurdles and has strong relationships with policymakers and regulators around the world.

Elon Musk
- New batteries plant
- Price cuts - gain in market share
- Scandals - employee


#### Short
Consumer discretionary
- Department stores
- Home-furnishing retails
- Apparel retail, stores

Reasons
- Uncertainty in the market with inflation still high - naturally funds flow into the bond market with less demand for consumer goods
- Inflation affects profitability and demand for these stores. Increased cost of production
- Weak real-estate markets might have led to this; with high mortgage rate caused by the interest rate hike, demand for housing/rentals are affected and thus demand for housing/family goods or office staples diminishes
