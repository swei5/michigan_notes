**Sales and trading** is one of the primary front-office divisions of major [investment banks]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_banking "Investment banking"). The term is typically reserved for the trading activities done by **sell-side investment banks** who are primarily engaged in **making markets** for institutional clients in various forms of securities. [[1]] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_and_trading#cite_note-1 ) The trading floor of these banks will contain [dedicated desks]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_desk "Trading desk") who generally focus exclusively on trading one form of security. These desks will more generally fall within the categories of fixed income, currencies, commodities, or equities.

In [market making]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_maker "Market maker"), traders will **buy and sell financial products** primarily to facilitate the **investment and trading activities of its clients** with the goal of making an incremental amount of money on each trade.

The term market maker refers to a firm or individual who actively quotes [two-sided markets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/two-sidedmarket.asp) in a particular security by providing [bids](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid.asp) and offers (known as [asks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/ask.asp)) along with the market size of each. Market makers provide [liquidity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp) and depth to markets and profit from the difference in the [bid-ask spread](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-askspread.asp).

### Market View
#### Continuous Hikes of the Interest Rate
March employment data still strong. With further rises in energy prices led by oil possible, rate hikes are still on the table.
- 70% rates of another round of interest rate hike next month
- Wait till the CPI stats tomorrow

It's already at 5 percent now and it was only 0.5 percent at this time last year. I think this is the fastest or steepest increase ever, unprecedented even during the 2008 financial crisis.

However, what's interesting is that the Fed also hinted that it may wrap up the rate hikes soon due to troubles in the banking sector. Serious difficulties at a small number of banks, namely the smaller-scale regional banks have emerged as we've saw over the couple of past weeks. 
- Hard-landing for lots of businesses and consumers

Although it may sound bizarre, the banking turmoil could have actually helped the Fed's efforts to curb borrowing and slow down the economy to combat inflation. As banks hunker down during the storm, it's likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses and to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. I think our inflation data is still high at 6%, this could help lower price growth, and we've also seen improvement since January so this could be a silver-lining.

#### Inflation
Obviously another big thing to watch for is inflation. In recent months, inflation has slowed but remains high. Consumer prices, for instance, are still roughly 6 percent higher than they were at this point last year, and many experts had urged the Fed to hold off on another increase until the dust had settled on the instability in the banking sector.

The regional banking crisis definitely warns the Fed about the potential hazard of continuing rising interest rate to combat inflation. So instead of the original target of a half percent increase, it is only one quarter. It is possible that the Fed can pause raising rates at this point, but the data on inflation (6% core CPI in feb 2023) is still higher than expected and the labor market is tighter than ever.

There’s a high degree of uncertainty now with respect to how the Fed will deal with inflation. We will have to speculate at this point I guess.
- Too high - fragile economy breaks into a recession
- Too low - inflation continues to haunt us

#### Reopening of China
Through fits and starts, China's relaxation of COVID restrictions may prompt a rebound in services activities and lead to a cyclical economic uptick. Not only it is a good signal for the country's economic recovery but also provides huge boost to our global economy. As Chinese consumers return to the mall and workspaces, we will anticipate a huge increase in domestic demand. This is welcome news for China’s regional neighbors, as Asia-Pacific economies export lots of goods to China.

It also stimulates international and business travels. A normalized travel pattern will ease supply chain frictions we've been witnessing for the past two years, and potentially leading to lower transportation costs and thus an increase in import/export volumes in China and a boost in foreign and Chinese GDP.

Other factors to consider: commodity market - oil demand.

Due to the faster-than-expected rate of reopening, our economists now forecast China’s GDP to grow by 6.5% in 2023

Over all, my expectation for the prospect of the market this year is mixed may be somewhat positive, with a potential upside of 3-5% for the S&P index.
- Much of growth is suppressed by the interest rate hike
- Interesting story I heard from podcast yesterday talking about Fed injecting a huge amount of cash to secure deposits in SVB, Signature and First Republic Bank. This is **quant easing**, reduces the risk of recession while not necessarily injecting more free cash into the Reopening of China
- Broad-based declines in asset prices in 2022 imply much cheaper valuations to start the year in 2023, with long-term valuations of bonds and non-US equities relatively attractive.
