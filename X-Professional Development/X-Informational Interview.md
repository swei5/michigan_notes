#### Transition
I would just like to say thank you so much for taking the time to meet with me today.  

#### Quick, really quick introduction
I'm a sophomore majoring in business at Ross with a dual degree in data science at LSA. I have a keen interest in both disciplines, so it has naturally come to me that sales and trading is a great fit that integrates quantitative data with the financial industry. I'm curious to learn more about your personal background, more specifically, what made you decide to go into S&T and how did you end up here?
