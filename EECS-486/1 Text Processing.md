[[2025-01-10]] #InformationRetrieval 

**Information Retrieval** (IR) is **finding material** (usually documents) of an **unstructured nature** (usually text) that satisfies an **information need** from within **large collections** (usually stored on computers).

These days we often think of Web search, but there are also other types of searches, e.g.:
- Search your own computer
- Search knowledge bases
- Search the library catalogue
- Search the deep Web (e.g., search for a certain car on a rental agency web page)

This class mainly focuses on the **indexing** and **retrieval** of textual documents.
- Concerned firstly with retrieving **relevant documents** to a query
- Concerned secondly with retrieving from **large** sets of documents **eï¬ƒciently**

```ad-example
**Example**: A Typical IR Task

Given:
- A corpus of textual natural-language documents
- A user query in the form of a textual string

Find:
- A ranked set of documents that are relevant to the query
