### Indices, ETF
An index is a fictional portfolio that replicates the performance of a group of stocks (the market).
- S&P Composite 1500: S&P 500, S&P 400 (Mid cap), S&P 600 (Small cap)
	- S&P 500 is 90% of the 1500 Composite

In a market capitalization-weighted index, each security is held based on its **proportion of total market capitalization**. Not all indices are market capitalization-weighted.

Investing in an index fund is a passive investment strategy that gives exposure to a broad market.
- Highly liquid
- Diversified

**Exchange-traded funds** (ETFs) are investment funds traded on an exchange.
- ETFs often mimic indices 
- However, there are active ETFs that attempt to earn higher returns than a benchmark

ETFs offer **low cost diversification** and **exposure to assets** that meet a specified criteria.
- A passive investor can diversify at low cost
- An active investor can get bet on a theme, while mitigating company-specific risk

ETFs (Index funds) are regarded as **benchmarks** for actively managed funds.

**Price Earning Ratio** (E/P) is the inverse of the **P/E Ratio**. We would prefer the price earning ratio because its distribution is less skewed.

**Book to Market Ratio** (B/M) is the ratio of the company's book value to its market capitalization. 

**Rating** codes: a score of 1 means buy or strong buy,Â **2 means outperform, 3 means hold**, 4 means underperform and 5 means sell.
- *To hold* generally means to sell

Note that earnings yield for smaller caps are more dispersed due to higher risks.

### Backtesting
To avoid survivorship bias, we want to pick the stocks that were in the index during the test period but not the best-performing ones.
