### Ethical Systems
We will study three main ethical systems to help structure and formalize moral intuitions.

#### Deontology

```ad-important
**Definition 7.1**: Deontology

A principles-oriented approach to moral reasoning
- Formulates moral obligations/duties in terms of **mandatory, universal rules**
- Morality is about what individuals “owe to each other” and "treat each other"
```

Under deontology, morality is **law-like**, i.e. there should be mandatory rules mandating people's moral codes. Deontologists try to find rules to live by.

Moral rules tell us
- [Kant’s “Categorical Imperative”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative)
- [The “Golden Rule”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule)

#### Consequentialism

```ad-important
**Definition 7.2**: Consequentialism

The principal that the goal of morality is to **maximize the good outcomes** (utility) while minimizing the bad ones.
```

The rule carries an impartiality: to evaluate utility for everyone, not just the impact of your actions on yourself.
- Global utility
- Finding imperfect solution for utilitarian causes

It focuses on **consequences of actions**, instead of **reasons of actions**.

#### Virtue Ethics

```ad-important
**Definition 7.3**: Virtue Ethics

Follows that morality as a search for “**the good life**”.

A virtuous action (according to Aristotle) is one that is:
1. Knowingly done
2. For its own sake, and
3. Consistent with, or because of, one's **good character**
```

### Ethical Heuristics
- The “Golden Rule”
	- Treating others as one would want to be treated by them
- The Role Reversal Test
- The 10/10/10 Rule
	- 10 minutes from now, how will I feel about this decision? 10 months from now, how will I feel about this decision? 10 years from now, how will I feel about this decision?
- The Front-Page Test
