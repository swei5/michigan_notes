	- [[8 Criminal Law|Fraud, bribery]], and [[4 Securities Regulation|insider trading]]
	- Mismanaged environmental disasters

### Ethical Systems
We will study three main ethical systems to help structure and formalize moral intuitions.

#### Deontology

```ad-important
**Definition 7.1**: Deontology

A principles-oriented approach to moral reasoning
- Formulates moral obligations/duties in terms of **mandatory, universal rules**
- Morality is about what individuals “owe to each other” and "treat each other"
```

Under deontology, morality is **law-like**, i.e. there should be mandatory rules mandating people's moral codes. Deontologists try to find rules to live by.

Moral rules tell us
- [Kant’s “Categorical Imperative”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative)
- [The “Golden Rule”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule)

#### Consequentialism

```ad-important
**Definition 7.2**: Consequentialism

The principal that the goal of morality is to **maximize the good outcomes** (utility) while minimizing the bad ones.
```

The rule carries an impartiality: to evaluate utility for everyone, not just the impact of your actions on yourself.
- Global utility
- Finding imperfect solution for utilitarian causes

It focuses on **consequences of actions**, instead of **reasons of actions**.

#### Virtue Ethics

```ad-important
**Definition 7.3**: Virtue Ethics

Follows that morality as a search for “**the good life**”.

A virtuous action (according to Aristotle) is one that is:
1. Knowingly done
2. For its own sake, and
3. Consistent with, or because of, one's **good character**
```

### Ethical Heuristics
- The “Golden Rule”
	- Treating others as one would want to be treated by them
- The Role Reversal Test
- The 10/10/10 Rule
	- 10 minutes from now, how will I feel about this decision? 10 months from now, how will I feel about this decision? 10 years from now, how will I feel about this decision?
- The Front-Page Test

---
### Rights
A right is an **entitlement to perform** (or abstain from) certain actions, AKA **privileges**, or to **prevent others from performing** (or abstaining from) certain actions, AKA **claims**.
- Examples include civil rights, aspirational rights, and procedural rights
- Example of privileges: driver's license
- Example of claims: property rights

In this section we will focus on the one of the utmost important rights, constitutional rights.

---
### Constitutional Rights
The US Constitution is primarily concerned with the 
- 1. Design and structure of the federal government, and
- 2. Relationship between state/federal governments 

```ad-note
Many amendments to US Constitution are focused on ensuring legal protection for individual rights  
- 1791: “Bill of Rights” (first 10 amendments) enacted  
	- Offers individual rights protection
- 1868: 14th Amendment enacted, incorporates Bill of Rights’ protections to state governments
	- Before the 14th Amendment the Bill of Rights only applies to the federal government
```

To nowadays, there are 26 amendments in total to the constitution.
#### The First Amendment

```ad-important
**Definition 7.4**: The First Amendment

**Congress shall make no law** respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or **abridging the freedom of speech**, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to  assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.
```

In essence, the First Amendment is a legal right providing **private individuals** (and businesses) with immunities **against certain types of government regulation** impacting ability to express themselves.
- Applies to federal government (not just congress)
- Applies to state governments (via 14 th Amendment)

```ad-important
The First Amendment **DOES NOT** apply to **private actors**.
```

That being said, a private employer can restrict free speech within their company however they want, and a social media site may have the power to display the content they want.

##### Protection
The First Amendment only protects a certain range of speeches. Unprotected speech receives **NO** constitutional protection. These include things that are immediate threats to the society:
- [[8 Criminal Law|Criminal speech acts]] (e.g., perjury, fraud, bribery) 
	- Inciting or producing imminent lawless actions
- Speech acts presenting a “clear and present danger”  
- [[4 Securities Regulation#^c95d0a|False/misleading commercial speech]] (e.g., advertising)  
- Obscenity
	- Really **HARD** to establish: has to be prurient, sordid, has no serious merit and on the whole offensive to the average person in a society

```ad-note
The word "speech" in this context can mean any expression of idea, or implied message, or a speech in general.
```

Degree of constitutional protections given to all other speech varies depending on several factors, the most important of which is the **type or nature of restriction** the government is trying to impose.
- E.g. content/viewpoint discrimination, prior restraint, time/place/manner regulations

##### Strict Scrutiny

```ad-important

**Definition 7.5**: Strict Scrutiny

Strict scrutiny is a form of judicial review that courts use to determine the **constitutionality of certain laws**. Strict scrutiny is often used by courts when a plaintiff sues the government for discrimination.
```

Strict scrutiny applies when a plaintiff sues the government for infringement on freedom of speech. Government's action is **unconstitutional UNLESS**
1. The government has a **compelling state interest** in regulation, and
2. The rule is **narrowly tailored** to satisfy such interest while **being the least restrictive means** for achieving that interest
#### Commercial Speech
Unlike political speech, commercial speech, especially advertising, has always been **subject to reasonable regulations regarding time, place, and manner**. In addition, the state may flatly prohibit false commercial speech, as well as explicitly or inherently misleading commercial speech.
