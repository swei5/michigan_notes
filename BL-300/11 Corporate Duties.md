Recall the [[3 Entities#^5c8a8d|roles in a corporation]]:
- Shareholders elect board of directors
- Board of directors
	- Pay out dividends
	- Make major decisions
	- Select and compensate officers

Within the corporate scope, today we will discuss **duty of care** and **duty of loyalty**.

### Business Judgement Rule

```ad-important
**Definition 11.1**: Business Judgement Rule

Directors **win** any lawsuit brought by shareholders alleging that the board made a wrong decision as long as:
1. The directors were **informed**
	- Were not making a grossly negligent decision
1. No directors had an **unacceptable conflict of interest**
```

```ad-info
**Case**: Smith vs. Van Gorkom
- Van Gorkom: CEO of transunion (D)
	- Allegedly didn't consult financial experts nor anyone on the board has financial expertise when selling the company at price of $55 per share
	- No due diligence and therefore were **NOT informed**
- Smith: Shareholder (P)
	- Believed the merger price is too low
	- Claimed breach of fiduciary duty
```

### Duty of Care
Recall the definition of **duty of care**: ![[5 Torts#^2c4d67]]
To satisfy duty of care, directors must
1. Implement and oversee appropriate risk management and compliance programs, and
2. Are **informed** all the time 

If breach of duty were to found, the directors that were responsible for the breach would be **personally liable** for the loss.
- **Limited liability** only applies to shareholders
- The legal damage is defined as the **difference** between the fair value (w/o the breach) and the actual value

#### Risk Avoidance
To avoid such risks, company may either
1. Purchase Directors and Officers Liability Insurance (DNL Insurance), or
2. Make bylaws that specify directors don't need to pay for damages related to breach of duty of care
	- This helps the corporation attract talents by taking a *risk on* attitude

### Duty of Loyalty

```ad-important
**Definition 11.2**: Duty of Loyalty

An employee should put the company's interest above one's personal interest at all time.

All agents owe their principal (their employer) a duty of loyalty and should treat opportunities in this same way.
```

A transaction made under a conflict of interest is **ONLY** **acceptable** if after **full disclosure of the conflict** and **approval** of either:
1. A majority of **disinterested directors**, or
2. The majority of **disinterested shareholders**

In other words, it means an employee must disclose any personal conflicts of interest when making a decision.

Usually the former will decide unless the entire board is conflicted.

If breach of loyalty is found, the actions are **reversed**, and the director who breached the duty would be **personally liable** for the cost.
- **NO bylaws** can be made

#### Corporate Opportunity Doctrine

```ad-important
**Definition 11.3**: Corporate Opportunity Doctrine

The specialized rule for situations where an **officer or director** considers taking a business opportunity states that they need to **disclose and offer**
