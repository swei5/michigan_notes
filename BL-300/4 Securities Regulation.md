#Trading #Law

Most securities regulation covered in class are derived from the [Securities Act of 1933](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_Act_of_1933) and the [Securities Exchange Act of 1934](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_Exchange_Act_of_1934).

### Overview of Raising Capital
Funding a business often means selling parts of the ownership to a third party. Depending on the type of sales, there are
- Public offering
- Private offering

Let's first go over the concept of securities.

---
### Securities

```ad-important
**Definition 4.1**: Securities

Securities are fungible and tradable **financial instruments** used to raise capital in public and private markets.
```

Broadly, securities include
- Normal stocks and bonds
- Investment contracts
- **Family resemblance test**: if any of the following is true, then the note is **NOT** a security
	- Consumer financing notes, such as short-term loans
	- Personal financing, such as mortgages

In determining whether if a financial instrument falls under the hood of securities, SEC also relies on what's known as the Howey Test.

```ad-important
**Definition 4.2**: Howey Test

The Howey Test states that securities are an **investment** of money in a common **enterprise** with **profits** to come **primarily from** the efforts of others.

Note that wording about profits has now changed from "completely" to "primarily".
```

The key characteristics here are
1. An investment of money
	- That means **NOT** consumption or expenditure
2. Common enterprise
	- To achieve this we need either **horizontal commonality** or **vertical commonality**
		- **Horizontal commonality**: **two or more investors** who **pool** their contributions and receive profits on a pro-rata basis
			- Same risk profile across shareholders
		- **Vertical commonality**: a **common interest** between the **investor** and the **promoter** or third party such that the fortunes of all investors are tied to the expertise of the promoter or third party
			- Commonality with investment
3. With profits
	- Expected profit also suffices
4. Primarily from the efforts of others

The definition of securities is really important because it is **ILLEGAL** to sell **unregistered securities**.
- In which case investors can claim 100% of their investment - no down side and infinite up side

### Private Offering
This is the more common way to raise capitals in corporate America. Only about 1% of exchanges of securities are in fact public offering, and most US companies are **NOT** listed on the public stock exchange.

```ad-important
**Definition 4.3**: Private Offering

A private placement is a sale of securities to **pre-selected investors** and institutions rather than publicly on the open market.
```

Most private offerings raise capital under **[Rule 506 (b) of Regulation D](https://www.sec.gov/education/smallbusiness/exemptofferings/rule506b#:~:text=Companies%20conducting%20an%20offering%20under,advertising%20to%20market%20the%20securities)**. This rule dictates that companies can
- Can sell to an unlimited number of **accredited investors** plus up to 35 non-accredited investors
	- Accredited investors include
		- Any director, executive officer, or partner of the issuer
		- Any individual with at least **$1 million** net worth, excluding primary residence
		- Any individual who earned at least **$200k** each of the last 2 years or joint income with spouse of at least $300k in those years and a reasonable expectation of same in current year
- Must have pre-existing relationship with the investor
- No general solicitation or advertising permitted
	- Combining this with the point above, companies are only allowed selling to pre-existing clients (or their agents)
- Limited disclosure requirements
- No registration required but they must file a form (Form D) with the SEC

---
### Public Offering
To sell shares to the public, a company needs to go through an **initial public offering**. There are three stages of this process in general.
1. Pre-filing
	- Company hires underwriters (usually IBs)
	- Company/underwriters conduct due diligence
	- Company/underwriters prepare registration statement
2. Filing review
	- Company files Registration Statement with the SEC
	- SEC reviews Registration Statement, provides comments
	- Company maintains quiet period; Underwriters conduct road show
		- Quiet period: to ensure fairness, companies refrain from communicating with investors to **avoid unfairly disclosing material**, non-public information to certain investors
3. Approval
	- SEC approves Registration Statement
	- Company/Underwriter decided effective date and pricing
	- Underwriters start selling shares on public exchange

Underwriters play a key role in assisting the IPO process especially regarding filing the registration statement. They also sell securities by means of
- **Firm commitment**: Agreement to assume all inventory risk and agreement to purchase all securities for an IPO directly from issuers for public sale
- **Best efforts**: **Does NOT** agree to purchase all of the securities from the issuer but will use their best efforts to act only as an agent to market the securities to investors

### Section 11 Claim
This is from the **Securities Act of 1933**. An investor can make a section 11 claim in the scenario where the company screws up its registration statement, such that
- There is **material misrepresentation** or omission in the registration statement
- The purchased shares traced back to the IPO (reliance on the registration statement)

The plaintiff has the right to sue the following parties
- The company
- Underwriters
- Inside directors such as the CEO
- Outside directors
- Officers

A legal tool to help the issuing parties avoid the liability for misstatements in a registration statement is **due diligence**. It is available to directors, officers, underwriters, outside experts, but **NOT** issuers (company).

Use the following chart to determine availability of due diligence.

### Overview of Securities Enforcement
We have covered the basics of securities in the segments above. Regarding securities enforcements, there are two main branches we will be looking at:
- Raising Capital under the 1933 Act (covered above)
	- Defining a security; selling securities to the public
	- Registration requirements; misstatements and omissions in the **registration statement** by Section 11
	- Only applies to **publicly trade companies** (IPO)
- Obligations of Securities Issuers under the 1934 Act
	- **Rule 10b-5** (i.e. 10b), widely applied **securities fraud** provision that applies to **public and private securities**
	- Prohibitions on insider trading

In general, the **Rule 10b-5** is much broader and covers all kinds of securities, instead of just public companies.

```ad-note
**Enforcers of Rule 10b-5**
- SEC
- DOJ
- **Shareholders**
	- Usually involves some sort of class action
- Whistle-blower
	- Don't initiate the lawsuit but instead refer it to the government for compensation

For a Section 11 claim, only the investors who purchased their shares through the IPO may file the lawsuit.
```

### Rule 10b-5

```ad-important
**Definition 4.4**: Elements of a 10-b5 Claim

Private plaintiffs must prove **all** elements:  
1. Misstatement or Omission (“M/O”) of a fact  
2. M/O must be material  
3. M/O made in connection with purchase or sale of security  
4. Scienter (M/O was made intentionally or recklessly)  
5. Reliance  
6. Loss Causation  
- (also (7) economic loss and (8) interstate commerce)
```

#### Misstatement or Omission (M/O)

^c95d0a

```ad-important
**Definition 4.5**: Misstatement or Omission

Requires the following two elements from the statement of a company:
- Includes any statement made by the company that is **misleading**, even if statement is technically factual  
- M/O must be **material**: Would a reasonable investor consider the information important
	- Must be relevant to the investor's decision
	- Statements such as a company's earning and assets are granted material

Puffing (marketing) are usually not viewed as a serious statement.
```

Companies, however, are usually **NOT required** to make any statements publicly and therefore could avoid misstatements or omission at all.
- Except for public companies who need to disclose financial details
- However, if companies chose **NOT to respond** in the case of a negative rumor, it is deemed essentially helping to spread misleading information

#### Scienter
This is the equivalent of *mens rea* in criminal laws.

```ad-important
**Definition 4.6**: Scienter

Requires the following of the statement made:
- Statement was made with **intent** to deceive, manipulate or defraud, **OR**  
- Statement was made in reckless disregard of its truth/falsity
```

Notice that due to the element of **intent**, a negligent yet material statement isn't enough to prove scienter, and nor does a genuine accident. 
- However, in these cases, companies have the duty of care to correct the problem when discovered

#### Reliance, Loss Causation

```ad-important
**Definition 4.7**: Reliance

There are **TWO** ways to demonstrate reliance:
1. **Direct reliance**
	- Plaintiff directly relies on the misstatement in their decision-making, OR
		- Usually applies to private companies
2. **Fraud on the Market**, for which we would only need:
	- The security is traded in a public market when the statement was made
	- Rationale behind this is the price is the M/O is already reflected in the price
```

Fraud on the Market turned out to be much easier to prove than direct reliance in most cases.

```ad-important
**Definition 4.8**: Loss Causations

For which we need to prove **TWO** things:
1. The price of the security **goes up** when the misstatement was published
2. The price of the security **goes down** when the reality was revealed
```

However, this is usually factually difficult to prove because of the confounding nature of the market.

In short, to bring a security fraud claim if we can prove that the misstatement leads to the actual purchasing/selling of shares.
- This implies that options and futures are excluded from the scope

Rule 10b-5 also sheds lights on the topic of **insider trading**.

#### Insider Trading
A judge-made law.

```ad-important
**Definition 4.9**: Insider Trading

A person commits insider trading in violation of Section 10(b) when  he/she:  
1. Trades on **material, nonpublic information**, and  
2. **Breaches a duty** under a theory of insider trading.
```

That being said, it is **NOT illegal** to trade on private information; it is only illegal in the case that one breaches a duty.
- **Employees** are allowed to trade during a specific **trading window** (usually occurs after the quarterly report)
- **Executives** are allowed to trade, but they'll need to send their trading plan to the SEC at least 60 days in advance
	- Motivation here is to notify the public about this action

There are three main types of insider trading.

##### Classical Insider Trading
Insider trading that operates as a fraud against the shareholders of the company whose stock was traded.

```ad-important
**Definition 4.10**: Classical Insider Trading

Classical insider trading occurs:  
1. When **an insider of the company** whose stock is being traded
	- An insider may be “temporary” and not a company employee (e.g., an  investment banker, lawyer, etc.)  
1. Trades while in possession of material, non-public information.  
```

This breaches the **duty of loyalty**.

##### Misappropriation
Misappropriation insider trading is a fraud, perpetrated by a **non-insider**, against the **source of the trader’s information**.
- Mutually exclusive with the classic insider trading theory

```ad-important
**Definition 4.11**: Misappropriation

Misappropriation occurs when
1. A trader, who is **NOT an insider** of the company gets material, non-public information 
2. From someone to whom the trader owes a **duty not to trade**...  
3. And trades anyway

For misappropriation purpose, non-insiders owe the following duties:  
- All **applicable fiduciary duties**, plus  
- Any duty established by **SEC Rule 10b5-2**
```

```ad-info
**Rule 10b5-2**: A trader owes a duty to the source of information in business/personal relations if:
- The trader agrees to maintain confidentiality  
- The trader and source have a practice of sharing known confidences, or  
- The source of information is the trader’s spouse, parent, child, sibling (unless the circumstances indicate that confidentiality is not expected)
```

##### Tipping Theory

```ad-important
**Definition 4.11**: Tipping Theory

Tipping occurs when:
1. A tipper — who is **would've committed classical insider trading or misappropriation** - gives material, nonpublic information
2. In breach of the tipper’s duty and for the **direct, or indirect,   personal benefit** of the tipper
3. To a tippee, who trades on the information when he or she knows (or should have known) that the information is **material, non-public information** obtained through a **breach of duty**.
