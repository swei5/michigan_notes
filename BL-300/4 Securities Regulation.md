Most securities regulation covered in class are derived from the [Securities Act of 1933](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_Act_of_1933) and the [Securities Exchange Act of 1934](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_Exchange_Act_of_1934).

### Overview of Raising Capital
Funding a business often means selling parts of the ownership to a third party. Depending on the type of sales, there are
- Public offering
- Private offering

Let's first go over the concept of securities.

### Securities

```ad-important
**Definition 4.1**: Securities

Securities are fungible and tradable **financial instruments** used to raise capital in public and private markets.
```

Broadly, securities include
- Normal stocks and bonds
- Investment contracts
- **Family resemblance test**: if any of the following is true, then the note is **NOT** a security
	- Consumer financing notes, such as short-term loans
	- Personal financing, such as mortgages

In determining whether if a financial instrument falls under the hood of securities, SEC also relies on what's known as the Howey Test.

```ad-important
**Definition 4.2**: Howey Test

The Howey Test states that securities are an **investment** of money in a common **enterprise** with **profits** to come **primarily from** the efforts of others.

Note that wording about profits has now changed from "completely" to "primarily".
```

The key characteristics here are
1. An investment of money
	- That means **NOT** consumption or expenditure
2. Common enterprise
	- To achieve this we need either **horizontal commonality** or **vertical commonality**
		- **Horizontal commonality**: **two or more investors** who **pool** their contributions and receive profits on a pro-rata basis
			- Same risk profile across shareholders
		- **Vertical commonality**: a **common interest** between the **investor** and the **promoter** or third party such that the fortunes of all investors are tied to the expertise of the promoter or third party
			- Commonality with investment
3. With profits
	- Expected profit also suffices
4. Primarily from the efforts of others

The definition of securities is really important because it is **ILLEGAL** to sell **unregistered securities**.
- In which case investors can claim 100% of their investment - no down side and infinite up side

### Private Offering
This is the more common way to raise capitals in corporate America. Only about 1% of exchanges of securities are in fact public offering, and most US companies are **NOT** listed on the public stock exchange.

```ad-important
**Definition 4.3**: Private Offering

A private placement is a sale of securities to **pre-selected investors** and institutions rather than publicly on the open market.
```

Most private offerings raise capital under **[Rule 506 (b) of Regulation D](https://www.sec.gov/education/smallbusiness/exemptofferings/rule506b#:~:text=Companies%20conducting%20an%20offering%20under,advertising%20to%20market%20the%20securities)**. This rule dictates that companies can
- Can sell to an unlimited number of **accredited investors** plus up to 35 non-accredited investors
	- Accredited investors include
		- Any director, executive officer, or partner of the issuer
		- Any individual with at least **$1 million** net worth, excluding primary residence
		- Any individual who earned at least **$200k** each of the last 2 years or joint income with spouse of at least $300k in those years and a reasonable expectation of same in current year
- Must have pre-existing relationship with the investor
- No general solicitation or advertising permitted
	- Combining this with the point above, companies are only allowed selling to pre-existing clients (or their agents)
- Limited disclosure requirements
- No registration required but they must file a form (Form D) with the SEC

### Public Offering
To sell shares to the public, a company needs to go through an **initial public offering**. There are three stages of this process in general.
1. Pre-filing
	- Company hires underwriters (usually IBs)
	- Company/underwriters conduct due diligence
	- Company/underwriters prepare registration statement
2. Filing review
	- Company files Registration Statement with the SEC
	- SEC reviews Registration Statement, provides comments
	- Company maintains quiet period; Underwriters conduct road show
		- Quiet period: to ensure fairness, companies refrain from communicating with investors to **avoid unfairly disclosing material**, non-public information to certain investors
3. Approval
	- SEC approves Registration Statement
	- Company/Underwriter decided effective date and pricing
	- Underwriters start selling shares on public exchange

Underwriters play a key role in assisting the IPO process especially regarding filing the registration statement. They also sell securities by means of
- **Firm commitment**: Agreement to assume all inventory risk and agreement to purchase all securities for an IPO directly from issuers for public sale
- **Best efforts**: **Does NOT** agree to purchase all of the securities from the issuer but will use their best efforts to act only as an agent to market the securities to investors

### Section 11 Claim
This is from the Securities Act of 1933. An investor can make a section 11 claim in the scenario where the company screws up its registration statement, such that
- There is material misrepresentation or omission in the registration statement
- The purchased shares traced back to the IPO (reliance on the registration statement)

The plaintiff has the right to sue the following parties
- The company
- Underwriters
- Inside directors such as the CEO
- Outside directors
- Officers

A legal tool to help the issuing parties avoid the liability for misstatements in a registration statement is **due diligence**. It is available to directors, officers, underwriters, outside experts, but **NOT** issuers (company).

Use the following chart to determine availability of due diligence.
