### Intellectual Property
We want to protect IP for two reasons:
1. Preventing invention
2. Protecting company's investment in their customers

There are two sets of IP tools in general.
- Preventing Others from **Making or Selling** Protected Products or Services
	- Trade Secret (state/federal)
	- Patent (federal)
	- Copyright (federal)  
- Preventing Others from Providing Consumers with False/Misleading Information; Protecting Famous Marks
	- Trademark (state/federal)
	- Unfair Competition (state/federal)

We will be discussing **trade secret** and **patent** today.

### Trade Secrets

```ad-important
**Definition 6.1**: Trade Secret

A trade secret is business or proprietary information that is formulas, processes, computer programs, customer and supplier lists, strategic business data, financial projections, research results, marketing strategies, customersâ€™ needs and profiles, business or product plans, even negative know-how.
```

Note that this is a **potentially very broad** list. Trade secrets are inherent to the company and doesn't require any filing to be valid. 
- Patents and trademarks, on the other hand, are **NOT**valid or valuable until they are file, and they only applies to certain things

**Negative know-how** are past evidence of **failures** and **trials** of a company. They are valuable because knowing this would save a significant amount of R&D costs by an outside party.
- Especially important in the pharmaceutical industry

To prove a trade secret infringement, we will need to show two facts.
1. Company has a trade secret protection program in place
2. There is misappropriation of trade secrets

#### Trade Secret Program
There are four components.
1. Notification of trade secret
	- Also known as "read-in", conducted when an employee is hired
2. Identification system
	-  Company needs to individuate any trade secrets in a clear and premise manner, but can't be **TOO** granular
1. Security
	- Reasonable measures and steps to protect trade secrets
	- These steps have to be **ABOVE** standards
1. Exit interview
	- Same as notification, also known as "read-out"

#### Misappropriation of Trade Secrets
This can be shown in **either** ways:
1. The trade secret is used or disclosed **WITHOUT** consent
2. Or is learned through improper means such as theft, bribe, corporate espionage,  breach of fiduciary duty (inducement of breach), or fraud

However, if a trade secret is learned in **other means** than these, it is **NOT** identified as a misappropriation, thus the company **CANNOT** file a lawsuit against the party who is allegedly using the trade secret.
- This turns out to be a huge weak spot

```ad-tldr
Protection from trade secret laws are pretty narrow. Trade secret is **no longer** a trade secret once it is publicly disclosed (though a company can still file a lawsuit for this). Hence, future misappropriation of such "secret" will **NOT** be protected.
```

### Patent

```ad-important
**Definition 6.2**: Patent

A patent is a **government-granted** right to **exclude** others from making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing into the United States an invention.  

There are three types of patents:
- Utility patent
- Design patent
- Plant patent
```

Patents are **time-bound** and **non-renewable** and under the **U.S. constitution** (federal law). 
- In short, this grants a **short-term monopoly**
- In contrast, a **trade secret** lasts **indefinitely** until disclosed
	- Patents and trade secrets are mutually exclusive
		- Filing a patent means **disclosure**
	- Patent laws offer **broader** protection than trade secret laws, which only protects misappropriations

A company needs to file a patent at the **Patent Trade Office** (PTO). We will be discussing two out of the three patent types below.

#### Utility Patent
There are four elements we need to look for to establish a utility patent.
1. Novel: is this an invention or innovation in their respective field?
2. Non-obvious
3. Useful
4. Patentable subject
	- The subject needs to be an application of ideas, but **NOT known** ideas
	- Or it can be new ideas that are **USEFUL**

A utility patent has a lifetime of 20 years.

#### Design Patent
There are three elements we need to look for to establish a utility patent.
1. Novel
2. Original
3. Ornamental: pertaining to the appearance and shape of the product
	- Opposite of utility patent

#### Patent Litigation Defense
There are two ways to defend against a **direct patent infringement** claim.
1. **Patent invalidity**
	- The subject matter should **NOT** be patentable in the first place (proving that it doesn't comply with at least one of the requirements of patent)
2. **Non-infringement**
	- The act does not really infringe plaintiff's patent

##### Innocent Infringement
Once direct infringement is established, the defendant can still argue for the case of **innocent infringement**.

Innocent infringement exists if
1. Infringement party claims **NOT knowing** the patent
2. And the patent holder didn't notify the public about the patent

```ad-note
Note that an innocent infringement is **STILL** an infringement - except that there is no punishment.
```

To disqualify innocent infringement, the plaintiff simply needs to tell the world about their patent.
- Through internet, it's fairly easy

If the plaintiff wins the case, the court has two ways of offering remedy to the plaintiff.
1. **Monetary compensation**
	- Most common way: how much the defendant made by exploiting the plaintiff's IP?
	- Preferred way
2. **Injunction**
	- Not preferred (costly and time-consuming)
