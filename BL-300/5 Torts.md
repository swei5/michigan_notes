### Torts
Previously, the majority of laws and regulations we studied are "laws of rights" - what legal rights one has.
- Establish a lawsuit
- Incorporation
- Securities regulations

Now, let's shift our focus to **laws of wrongs**. They include
- **Criminal Law**: **Severe** wrongs, enforced by the state on behalf of **society**
- **Tort Law**: Interpersonal wrongs, **injured party** gets to decide whether to hold her tortfeasor accountable

Not every harm is a wrong, and not every wrong is a tort.

The remedy to a tort is usually some kind of monetary compensation for the damages made.

### Defamation
Defamation is a type of tort. To prove defamation of character, a plaintiff needs the following:
1. False statement
2. Damages
3. Publication

We will cover these factors in depth.

There are two types of defamation we will cover
1. Slander
	- Transitory or oral
2. Libel
	- Permanent or written

#### False Statement
To simply put, this means that a statement that the one makes is **objectively untrue**. Note that **opinions** or any subjective statements are not classified as statements, which includes phrases like
- "I think, IMO, etc."

#### Publication
The statement needs to be made in or to the presence of a third-party (which can also be an agent of the defendant) at least verbally or in writing.
- The third-party could be anyone, including one's family and friends
- This includes social media by default

#### Damages
The false statement causes real harm to plaintiff's personal life or reputation that demands some form of compensation.

```ad-note
By [Section 230, Title 47 of the United States Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_230), social media are **NOT** liable for wrongful content posted on the social media platform by third-parties. It provides immunity from liability for social media platforms.
```

#### Slander Per Se
In some circumstances, plaintiff **DOES NOT** need to claim damages made by the false statement, and slander/libel (libel per se) would be automatically granted.

```ad-important
**Definition 5.1**: Defamation Per Se

There are four main ways to classify false statements that the law presumes to be harmful to a person's reputation.
- Statement regarding someone committed a crime or immoral conduct
- Statement regarding someone had a contagious, infectious, or "loathsome" disease
- Statement regarding someone engaged in sexual misconduct
- Harmful Statement regarding someone's business or profession
```

### Public Disclosure of Private Facts
The tort of public disclosure of private facts requires that a plaintiff needs to prove that the disclosed information is
1. **Non-news** worthy facts
	- Publication about private matters - intuitively this does not apply to celebrities
2. Facts that are reasonable personal privacy that could be offensive if disclosed

### Intrusion (on seclusion)
Another privacy-related tort. This requires that a plaintiff needs to prove that there is
1. Objectionable prying
	- E.g. eavesdropping, wire-tapping, snooping, and any objectionable prying
2. Reasonable expectation for privacy in which the intrusion takes place
	- E.g. Home, private spaces

### Negligence
This is the **CORE** of tort laws. In essence, negligence is about the some party's negligent act exposing risks and damages on the other party.

Elements of a negligence claim includes
- Duty
- Breach
- Causation
- Harm

#### Duty of Care

```ad-important
**Definition 5.2**: Duty of Care

Generally, duty of care requires a person with a **legal duty** to another must act like a **reasonable person** to avoid harming the other person.
```

For example, drivers have a duty not to text and drive. 

##### Duty of Property Owners
Apart from the owner of the property, there are three types of people when discussing acts related to property.
- Licensees
	- People who had the owner's consents to visit
	- E.g. friends and family, salesperson (if having conversation with them)
- Invitees
	- People who visit for business purposes
	- E.g. pizza delivery person
- Trespassers

Property owners have duty to invitees that they need to **protect** invitees from **ALL dangerous** conditions that they know or should've known.

Property owners have duty to licensees that they need to **warn** licensees from **KNOWN and hard-to-find dangers**.

Property owners do **NOT** have any duty to trespassers.
- With the exception of kids

---
#### Causation and Harm
There are two types of causation that needs to be established to determine the causation-harm relationship. The plaintiff need to show that **breach of duty** is the **actual and proximate cause** that imposes the harm to hold the defendant liable.

##### Actual Causation
Also called *cause in fact*. It is the event that was the **immediate** and **direct** cause of an accident. We use the **but-for test** to determine actual causation. The test asks
- "but for (without) the existence of X, would Y have occurred?"
	- If it would, that conduct is **NOT** the cause of the harm

##### Proximate Causation
It is an event **sufficiently related** to an injury that the courts deem the event to be the cause of that injury. We use the **foreseeable test** to determine proximate causation. The test asks
- How likely it was that the plaintiff could have anticipated the potential or actual results of their actions? This breaks down to
	- Were the consequences foreseeable?
	- Was the plaintiff foreseeable? (zone of danger)

#### Negligence Per Se
Similar to defamation, there is also a quick way to go about establishing negligence.

```ad-important
**Definition 5.3**: Negligence Per Se

If there is a law statute that prohibits a negligent act, it is inherently identified as **negligent** regardless of being "**reasonable**" or not.
```

#### Res Ipsa Loquitur
This is another way to prove duty, breach, and causation **indirectly**. In Latin, this translates to "the thing speaks for itself".

```ad-important
**Definition 5.4**: Res Ipsa Loquitur

The plaintiff can create a rebuttable presumption of negligence by the defendant by proving the following:
1. The plaintiff was harmed by something **controlled exclusively** by the defendant
2. Generally people don't get harmed in situation like this unless someone is **negligent**
3. The plaintiff is **NOT** negligent
```

---
### Defense to Negligence
There are two main ways that the defendants could argue about the case, even after negligence has been established.
1. Assumption of risk
	- The plaintiff voluntarily chooses to undertake activities knowing the risks beforehand
2. Comparative negligence
	- The plaintiff is **ALSO** negligence
	- Then the fact-finders determine what percentage of damage each party is responsible for, then base the compensation on the percentage
