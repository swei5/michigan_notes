### Torts
Previously, the majority of laws and regulations we studied are "laws of rights" - what legal rights one has.
- Establish a lawsuit
- Incorporation
- Securities regulations

Now, let's shift our focus to **laws of wrongs**. They include
- **Criminal Law**: **Severe** wrongs, enforced by the state on behalf of **society**
- **Tort Law**: Interpersonal wrongs, **injured party** gets to decide whether to hold her tortfeasor accountable

Not every harm is a wrong, and not every wrong is a tort.

The remedy to a tort is usually some kind of monetary compensation for the damages made.

### Defamation
Defamation is a type of tort. To prove defamation of character, a plaintiff needs the following:
1. False statement
2. Damages
3. Publication

We will cover these factors in depth.

There are two types of defamation we will cover
1. Slander
	- Transitory or oral
2. Libel
	- Permanent or written

#### False Statement
To simply put, this means that a statement that the one makes is **objectively untrue**. Note that **opinions** or any subjective statements are not classified as statements, which includes phrases like
- "I think, IMO, etc."

#### Publication
The statement needs to be made in or to the presence of a third-party (which can also be an agent of the defendant) at least verbally or in writing.
- The third-party could be anyone, including one's family and friends
- This includes social media by default

#### Damages
The false statement causes real harm to plaintiff's personal life or reputation that demands some form of compensation.

```ad-note
By [Section 230, Title 47 of the United States Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_230), social media are **NOT** liable for wrongful content posted on the social media platform by third-parties. It provides immunity from liability for social media platforms.
```

#### Slander Per Se
In some circumstances, plaintiff **DOES NOT** need to claim damages made by the false statement, and slander/libel (libel per se) would be automatically granted.

```ad-important
**Definition 5.1**: Defamation Per Se

There are four main ways to classify false statements that the law presumes to be harmful to a person's reputation.
- Statement regarding someone committed a crime or immoral conduct
- Statement regarding someone had a contagious, infectious, or "loathsome" disease
- Statement regarding someone engaged in sexual misconduct
- Harmful Statement regarding someone's business or profession
```

### Public Disclosure of Private Facts
The tort of public disclosure of private facts requires that a plaintiff needs to prove that the disclosed information is
1. **Non-news** worthy facts
	- Publication about private matters - intuitively this does not apply to celebrities
2. Facts that are reasonable personal privacy that could be offensive if disclosed

### Intrusion (on seclusion)
Another privacy-related tort. This requires that a plaintiff needs to prove that there is
1. Objectionable prying
	- E.g. eavesdropping, wire-tapping, snooping, and any objectionable prying
2. Reasonable expectation for privacy in which the intrusion takes place
	- E.g. Home, private spaces

### Negligence
This is the **CORE** of tort laws. In essence, negligence is about the some party's negligent act exposing risks and damages on the other party.

Elements of a negligence claim includes
- Duty
- Breach
- Causation
- Harm

#### Duty of Care

```ad-important
**Definition 5.2**: Duty of Care

Generally, duty of care requires a person with a **legal duty** to another must act like a **reasonable person** to avoid harming the other person.
```

^2c4d67

For example, drivers have a duty not to text and drive. 

##### Duty of Property Owners
Apart from the owner of the property, there are three types of people when discussing acts related to property.
- Licensees
	- People who had the owner's consents to visit
	- E.g. friends and family, salesperson (if having conversation with them)
- Invitees
	- People who visit for business purposes
	- E.g. pizza delivery person
- Trespassers

Property owners have duty to invitees that they need to **protect** invitees from **ALL dangerous** conditions that they know or should've known.

Property owners have duty to licensees that they need to **warn** licensees from **KNOWN and hard-to-find dangers**.

Property owners do **NOT** have any duty to trespassers.
- With the exception of kids

---
#### Causation and Harm
There are two types of causation that needs to be established to determine the causation-harm relationship. The plaintiff need to show that **breach of duty** is the **actual and proximate cause** that imposes the harm to hold the defendant liable.

##### Actual Causation
Also called *cause in fact*. It is the event that was the **immediate** and **direct** cause of an accident. We use the **but-for test** to determine actual causation. The test asks
- "but for (without) the existence of X, would Y have occurred?"
	- If it would, that conduct is **NOT** the cause of the harm

##### Proximate Causation
It is an event **sufficiently related** to an injury that the courts deem the event to be the cause of that injury. We use the **foreseeable test** to determine proximate causation. The test asks
- How likely it was that the plaintiff could have anticipated the potential or actual results of their actions? This breaks down to
	- Were the consequences foreseeable?
	- Was the plaintiff foreseeable? (zone of danger)

#### Negligence Per Se
Similar to defamation, there is also a quick way to go about establishing negligence.

```ad-important
**Definition 5.3**: Negligence Per Se

If there is a law statute that prohibits a negligent act, it is inherently identified as **negligent** regardless of being "**reasonable**" or not.
```

#### Res Ipsa Loquitur
This is another way to prove duty, breach, and causation **indirectly**. In Latin, this translates to "the thing speaks for itself".

```ad-important
**Definition 5.4**: Res Ipsa Loquitur

The plaintiff can create a rebuttable presumption of negligence by the defendant by proving the following:
1. The plaintiff was harmed by something **controlled exclusively** by the defendant
2. Generally people don't get harmed in situation like this unless someone is **negligent**
3. The plaintiff is **NOT** negligent
```

### Defense to Negligence
^a11100

There are two main ways that the defendants could argue about the case, even after negligence has been established.
1. Assumption of risk
	- The plaintiff voluntarily chooses to undertake activities knowing the risks beforehand
2. Comparative negligence
	- The plaintiff is **ALSO** negligence
	- Then the fact-finders determine what percentage of damage each party is responsible for, then base the compensation on the percentage

---
### Product Liability
There are two ways to determine product liability:
1. Breach of Warranty (focus later this semester)
2. Negligence (Previously covered)
3. **Strict Liability** - California 1963
	- Applies to products only
	- Easier to establish compared to negligence

```ad-important
**Definition 5.5**: Strict Product Liability

A seller or manufacturer being held responsible, **regardless of intent or negligence**, for selling or placing a defective product into the hands of a consumer.
```

To claim strict liability, a plaintiff needs to claim that
1. Plaintiff **harmed** by defendant’s product
2. Injury **caused** by a defect in the product, and
3. The **defect existed** at the time the product left the defendant and **DID NOT** change substantially along the way

Note that (1) and (2) are essentially the **causation-harm** clause in negligence.

Defects can be broken down into the following categories.
- **Manufacturing Defects**
	- Units **failed to meet the internal specification** of that product because of some kinds of **flaws in the manufacturing** products.
		- E.g. incomplete components, incorrect installation, any evidence that shows divergence from the product specficiation
- **Warning Defects**
	- There is **NO** adequate warnings to the foreseeable **risks** that are inherent to the product
		- Warning defects exist to cover the **residual risk** that exists but cannot fix fundamental defects
		- The more riskier the product, the more warning there should be
		- E.g. lawn mower **MUST** have some warning sign as it carries inherent ris
- **Design Defects**
	- Different states apply different tests to determine
		- **Risk-Utility Balancing Test**
			- `[](risk > utility) -> { defects : !defects }`
		- **Reasonable Alternative Design Test**
			- Plaintiff needs to **bring an alternative design to court**, proving that the original has defects
			- **OR**, shows that the defendant has considered choosing an alternative design but went with a different one
				- This is done through [[1 Business Litigation#^9e5aa8|discovery]]

---
### Defense to Product Liability
There are two main ways that the defendants could argue about the case, even after strict product liability has been established.
1. Assumption of risks
	- If customer keeps using it, it is implied that they **deliberately choose** to take on the risk
1. Comparative fault
	- Discount the damage if plaintiff is also negligent

Note that these are the same ones as what we've seen in [[#^a11100|negligence]].

---
### Product Liability & Supply Chain
As long as **defect existed** when products left a party's hand, that party can be held **liable**.
- This implies **ALL** upstream parties are **[[3 Entities#^9bef8b|joint and severally liable]]** for the injury

![[Pasted image 20231002121322.png|600]]

To mitigate such risks, producers can
- Establish **contracts** with suppliers
	- Suppliers are liable for any defects occurred during their manufacturing stage
- Vertical integration

```ad-note
Sellers of **used-goods** **CANNOT** be sued for strict liability. However, this only excludes the salesperson in the chain; if defects exist beforehand and there is **NO** significant change, then all upstream suppliers can still be sued.
```

In recent era, there has been dispute as to whether **software** is a product or a service.
- By recognizing it as a service, software companies can avoid strict product liability
- However, the trade-off is that stock price of a software "product" company is 5x to 8x higher than a software "service" company
