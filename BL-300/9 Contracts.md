In essence, a contract is a **meeting of the minds**.

### Contracts, Common Law

```ad-important
**Definition 9.1**: Elements of a valid Contract

**Always required** for contract formation:  
1. **Agreement** between the parties,  
2. **Consideration** provided by each party,  
3. **Capacity** of each party, and  
4. **Legal purpose** of the agreement

Sometimes required for contract formation: **Statute of Frauds**.
```

We will now break down into these components and discuss their meanings.

#### Agreement
An agreement must be **outwardly manifested**. An agreement requires a valid offer and acceptance. There are two tests we can apply to check the validity of an **offer**.

```ad-important
**Definition 9.2**: Definite Offer Test

An definite offer must include these essential terms:
- Subject matter
- Time
- Price
- Payment, and
- Duration

Without sufficing these terms, there is **NO** definite offer. **If there is no definite offer and acceptance, then the contract is void**.
```

##### Counter-Offer
A counteroffer is inherently a **rejection** and a **new offer**. In essence, anything that is **NOT an acceptance** is a **rejection**.

The other way to examine the validity of the offer is the **Mirror Image Rule**.

```ad-important
**Definition 9.3**: Mirror Image Rule

An offer must be accepted exactly with no modifications to the original terms; else, it's a **rejection**.
```

An exception to this is advertisement. 

#### Void and Voidable Contracts

```ad-important
**Definition 9.4** Void and Voidable

A **voidable contract** is a **real contract**, but **defected**. The participants have the legal option to bail out of the contract at any time.

A **void contract** is **NOT** a contract and has **NO legal capacity**.
```

#### Duress and Fraud
Contracts formed under duress or fraud are **defected** and **voidable**.
- Duress: acquiescence, threats, blackmails, illegal forces
- Fraud: disclosure of **necessary information** is required, otherwise seen as fraudulent

#### Consideration
