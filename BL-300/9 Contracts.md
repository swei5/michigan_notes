In essence, a contract is a **meeting of the minds**.

### Contracts, Common Law

```ad-important
**Definition 9.1**: Elements of a valid Contract

**Always required** for contract formation:  
1. **Agreement** between the parties,  
2. **Consideration** provided by each party,  
3. **Capacity** of each party, and  
4. **Legal purpose** of the agreement

Sometimes required for contract formation: **Statute of Frauds**.
```

We will now break down into these components and discuss their meanings.

#### Agreement
An agreement must be **outwardly manifested**. An agreement requires a valid offer and acceptance. There are two tests we can apply to check the validity of an **offer**.

```ad-important
**Definition 9.2**: Definite Offer Test

An definite offer must include these essential terms:
- Subject matter
- Time
- Price
- Payment, and
- Duration

Without sufficing these terms, there is **NO** definite offer. **If there is no definite offer and acceptance, then the contract is void**.
```

##### Counter-Offer
A counteroffer is inherently a **rejection** and a **new offer**. In essence, anything that is **NOT an acceptance** is a **rejection**.

The other way to examine the validity of the offer is the **Mirror Image Rule**.

```ad-important
**Definition 9.3**: Mirror Image Rule

An offer must be accepted exactly with no modifications to the original terms; else, it's a **rejection**.
```

An exception to this is advertisement. 

#### Void and Voidable Contracts

```ad-important
**Definition 9.4** Void and Voidable

A **voidable contract** is a **real contract**, but **defected**. The participants have the legal option to bail out of the contract (1) during the time that one is still subject to it, or (2) as soon as the contract ends.

A **void contract** is **NOT** a contract and has **NO legal capacity**.
```

#### Duress and Fraud
Contracts formed under duress or fraud are **defected** and **voidable**.
- Duress: acquiescence, threats, blackmails, illegal forces
- Fraud: disclosure of **necessary information** is required, otherwise seen as fraudulent

#### Consideration
Consideration essentially means something **of legal value**.
- Each party has to give something of legal value to the other party in a contract
- E.g. time, money, favor

This **distinguishes a contract from a gift**.

There are two types of contracts by consideration.
- **Bilateral contract**
	- Consideration, or promises of consideration are given from **both sides**
		- Most common
- **Unilateral contract**
	- **The consideration is the acceptance of contract**; signed and finished at the same time
		- E.g. rewards

#### Capacity
An individual has the capacity to engage in contracting unless they are affiliated with circumstances such as:
1. Intoxication  
2. Minority (underage)  
3. Mental incompetence (judicially determined)

Contracts made **WITHOUT capacity** are **voidable**.
- They are **void**, however, if the contracting party is decided to be **mentally incompetent** by the court

#### Legal Purpose
Contracts **CANNOT be illegal**. Illegal contracts are **void**.
- Agreements to break the law
- Violations of public policy
	- E.g. wrongful discharge, non-competes

##### Non-Competes
Non-competes are often included as **parts of the contract** and are enforced by jurisdiction. 

```ad-important
**Definition 9.5**: Non-Compete

An agreement where one party promises not to engage in conduct that would increase competition for the other party **for a specific period of time post-employment**.
```

Most jurisdictions will enforce a non-compete agreements if
1. The non-compete protects the employer's legitimate business interest, and
2. The restrictions it imposes are reasonable with respect to
	- **Duration**: mostly expires in **six months**, the maximum is **two years**
	- **Geography**: limited
	- **Activity**: restricted

If a non-competition agreement does not serve a lawful purpose, it is **void.**

The trend is that most non-competes are under high scrutiny for protection of low-wage workers; California has made non-competes entirely **void**.

```ad-note
Non-compete mostly applies to **high-skill workers** only.
```

#### Statute of Frauds
It applies to contracts involving
- Sales of real estate
- Contracts **CAN'T BE** completed in one calendar year, etc.

Contracts of the above categories that are not signed in writing are **voidable**.

```ad-important
**Definition 9.6**: Statute of Frauds

A statute requiring certain contracts to be **in writing and signed** by the parties bound byÂ the contract. The purpose is to prevent fraud and other injury.
```

#### Contract Breach and Remedy
A legal breach in contract would require some legal source:  [morality clause]( https://www.pon.harvard.edu/daily/business-negotiations/preparing-for-the-worst-in-business-negotiations-nb/#:~:text=What%20Is%20a%20Morality%20Clause ,life%20 of%20 the%20 employee's%20 contract.)

Otherwise, an injured party has the right to claim a breach in contract and seek corresponding remedy. 

The **legal damage** is determined by approximating the differences between the scenario in which both parties would be in **without the breach, at the end of the contract**, and **reality**.

However, the injured party has the **duty to mitigate**. That is, it must take **reasonable steps** to mitigate damages suffered.
- E.g. looking for a comparable job

```ad-note
If the party failed to show efforts in mitigate, there will be **NO remedy**. If the party did show efforts of mitigation, then they can be compensated by the original offeror for the **differences** between the payout assumed no breach of contract and the status quo.
```
