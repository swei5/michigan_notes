### Criminal Law and Civil Law
In previous chapters, we have covered extensively about **civil laws**, which concerns:
- **Interpersonal** wrongdoings
- Punishment is usually **compensation**
- Lawsuits **by individuals**

Criminal laws, however, concern deeper issues related to the society.
- Wrongdoings to the **society**
- Punishment is usually **incarceration or imprisonment** (harsher)
- Prosecuted by the government, brought by a **state or federal prosecutor**

Torts and crimes are **NOT mutually exclusive**.

```ad-important
**Definition 8.1**: Mens Rea

In criminal law, mens rea, or "guilty mind", is the mental state of a defendant who is accused of committing a crime.

Different mental states lead to different kinds of crimes.
```

A criminal case requires both **mens rea** and **facts**, and thus carry a higher burden of proof to win a criminal case (“beyond a reasonable doubt”) than to win a civil case (“preponderance of the evidence”).

```ad-summary
**Civil Case vs Criminal Case**
- Civil: court decides which side is more likely to be believable (> 50% likelihood of guilt)
- Crime: court requires beyond a reasonable doubt (> 90% of likelihood of guilt)

It is **a lot harder** for prosecution to win a criminal case.
```

### White-Collar Crime
More influential than perceived - the economic impact from business crimes is a magnitude greater than street crime.

Leading sources of white-collar prosecutions include:
- Fraud
	- Any deception intended to induce someone to part with property or money
- [[#^fffb9d|Bribery]] and money laundering 
- Food and (pharmaceutical) drugs  
- Antitrust  
- Environmental crimes

In the list above, fraud and bribery consist the majority.

### RICO

```ad-important
**Definition 8.2**: RICO

The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) is a **federal law** targeting organized criminal activity and racketeering. RICO targets **augmented, organized crimes** by connecting **small wrongdoings to a single act of crime**.
- Strict punishment
- Super-charging
```

RICO prohibits (1) investing, (2) acquiring in interests, (3) participating in, or (4) conspiring to conduct racketeering activities in an enterprise.

#### RICO Elements
To claim a RICO violation, we need to show the following:
1. Conduct
	- Party is **associated** with and **carried out** the directions of the enterprise
	- Requires **direct evidence**, regardless of conductor being high or low level employee
	- **EASY** to prove in business context
2. Racketeering Activity
	- E.g. [[#^3e99ad|Mail and wire fraud]], Bribery, Fraud, 35 crimes in total
	- Each act (to each party) counts as **one** instance, separately
3. Pattern of Racketeering Activity
	- Need **at least 2 acts** of racketeering activity within 10 years
4. Enterprise
	- Racketeering activities have to be committed **THROUGH** this associated enterprise
	- **EASY** to prove in business context

Apart from the "augmented" RICO claim, a prosecutor can also sue for individual crimes that make up the RICO case.

### Mail and Wire Fraud

^3e99ad
A federal crime. To prove the crime, the prosecutor needs to establish **TWO elements**:
- There are false representations that were material to the **scheme to defraud**, and
- The scheme was transmitted by wire, radio, or television communications in interstate commerce
	- Being interstate allows federal government to have [[1 Business Litigation#^7609e2|personal jurisdiction]]

We don't need to demonstrate that there is a victim - all required is that there exists a scheme.

---
### False Statement Act
Targets **make-up crimes**.

To prove a False Statement Act violation, the government must establish that the defendant:
- Made a **materially false statement** in any matter
	- Doesn't matter the motivation or even if it has to do with a crime
- Within the **jurisdiction of the federal government**,
- **To a government official**

In this case, the best way to avoid this potential liability is to shut up.
- [The fifth amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution ) grants that power
- Silence cannot be treated as evidence of convicted crimes

---
### Vicarious Liability
Vicarious liability describes how one can be prosecuted **for someone else's** crime. Note that previously we've seen [[2 Agency#^5cf0d8|Respondeat Superior]], which applies to both crimes and torts.

We will focus on the Responsible Corporate Officer Doctrine. This is much narrower than Respondeat Superior, as it applies to **supervisors ONLY**.

```ad-important
**Definition 8.3**: Responsible Corporate Officer Doctrine

A strict personal liability theory interpreted by the government as permitting (in certain circumstances) the **prosecution of corporate officers and directors** for misdemeanor criminal offenses **WITHOUT** the need to establish their intent or personal involvement in wrongful conduct.
```

The rule of thumb is that:

```python
if orders_to_commit_crime:
	CRIME
elif was_responsible and can_prevent
	CRIME
elif not_knowing and didnot_order:
	COMPANY_CANT_FIRE
```

Governments would offer financial incentive to officers who **disclose** crimes.

---
### Bribery

^fffb9d
```ad-important
**Definition 8.4**: Bribery

The offering, giving, soliciting, or **receiving of any item of value** as a means of influencing the actions of an individual holding a **public or legal duty**.
```

There is an inherent risk for conducting global businesses:
- Corporations must usually secure licenses, permits, registrations, or other government approvals
- Foreign government may require appointment of a “sponsor,” which is required to be paid on an annual basis

All of these factors could give rise to the crime of bribery.

---
### FCPA
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) is established in the premise of a US-centric global economy. 
- Extremely powerful and popular
- Other bribery laws model the FCPA
- Jointly enforced by the SEC and DOJ

#### Reach
The FCPA has extensive reach (**enforced worldwide**):
- To US persons and companies who commit designated acts abroad
- To non-US persons/companies where any part of the bribery **touches the United States**
	- Shareholders, employees, officers, partners

```ad-note
There is separate statutes that apply to U.S. government officials only regarding bribery.
```

#### Provision
There are two primary provisions of the FCPA:
1. The Anti-Bribery Provision
	- FCPA prohibits bribes or anything of value being paid to **foreign government officials** to aid in **obtaining or retaining business**
		- Foreign government officials are individuals **employed or associated** with a foreign government or state-owned businesses
	- Applies to anywhere in the world of US citizens, US companies, and **payments by non-US companies** that "touch on" the United States
2. The Accounting Provision
	- Requires that US public companies **keep books and records** that accurately reflect their business transactions

```ad-important
The penalty of violating the FCPA is **two times** the amount of the potential benefit of the bribery.
```

#### Exception
The FCPA doesn't apply to the following situations:
- Expediting or facilitating payments
- Lobbying

Naturally, the US government **CANNOT** prosecute foreign government officials that reside in a foreign country, though they violated the FCPA.
- **NO personal jurisdiction**
	- However, this crime bars this individual from traveling to the US
	- Or, seek expedition

In other words, the FCPA **DOESN'T** prohibit the **RECEIVING of bribery**.
