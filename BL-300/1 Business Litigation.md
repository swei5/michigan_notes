#### Personal Jurisdiction
A state has personal jurisdiction if any of the four circumstances are true:
- Consent
- Citizenship ^7dccbc
	- For states, this is their headquarter or incorporation location
- Service (Individuals)
	- If the individual physically **hands papers** to the defendant within a state, then that state has jurisdiction
- Long-arm statute
	- A state may reach out and grab an individual or entity to take the case. The following needs to be satisfied
		- The basis of the lawsuit must occurred in **the state**
		- The defendant must have [[#^5ece92|Minimum contacts]] with **the state**
- Mallory Rule (Business)
	- Personal jurisdiction for out-of-state business exists if
		- State law requires an out-of-state company to register before doing business in the state
		- The state's foreign business registration statute requires any registered company to agree appear-in-state in response to any cause of action

#### Subject Matter Jurisdiction
Most states courts are courts of general jurisdiction - meaning they have the jurisdiction to hear cases of any subject matter. State courts **MUST** hear all state law claims.

A federal trial court has SMJ if either of the following are true
- Diversity Jurisdiction
	- Diverse citizenship is both parties and claim > $75,000
- Federal Question Jurisdiction
	- The case must involve a federal question arising under federal law

**Definition 1.1**: Summary Judgement

A decision made based on statements and evidence without going to trial. Summary judgement can be reached, when
- There is no factual dispute
- Decision reached as a **matter of law**
```

```ad-note
Facts influence people's behaviors. Lots of parties will decide to **END** the lawsuit after **discovery**, where lots of *unwanted* evidence may be presented.
```

Discovery is a process that only exists in the U.S. litigation system. It is often viewed as extremely time and resource-consuming. ^9e5aa8

### Class Action

```ad-important
**Definition 1.2**: Class Action

A class action is a legal proceeding in which one or more plaintiffs bring a lawsuit on behalf of a larger group, known as the class.
```

The motivations of having a class action as opposed to individual lawsuits include
- Economic efficiency
- Larger impact due to collective efforts
- Larger pool of audience and therefore more legal resources
- Consists a larger case for the court's consideration

To hold a class action, **commonalities** must be achieved.
- The class members' claims share common questions of law or fact
	- The class action **DOES NOT** interfere discretionary acts
	- Individuals suffer from the **SAME** level of **legal injuries**
