**Definition 1.1**: Summary Judgement

A decision made based on statements and evidence without going to trial. Summary judgement can be reached, when
- There is no factual dispute
- Decision reached as a **matter of law**
```

```ad-note
Facts influence people's behaviors. Lots of parties will decide to **END** the lawsuit after **discovery**, where lots of *unwanted* evidence may be presented.
```

Discovery is a process that only exists in the U.S. litigation system. It is often viewed as extremely time and resource-consuming.

### Class Action

```ad-important
**Definition 1.2**: Class Action

A class action isÂ a legal proceeding in which one or more plaintiffs bring a lawsuit on behalf of a larger group, known as the class.
```

The motivations of having a class action as opposed to individual lawsuits include
- Economic efficiency
- Larger impact due to collective efforts
- Larger pool of audience and therefore more legal resources
- Consists a larger case for the court's consideration

To hold a class action, **commonalities** must be achieved.
- The class members' claims share common questions of law or fact
	- The class action **DOES NOT** interfere discretionary acts
	- Individuals suffer from the **SAME** level of **legal injuries**
